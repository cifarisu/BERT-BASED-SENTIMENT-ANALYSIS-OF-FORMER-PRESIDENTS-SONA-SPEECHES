 state nation address excellency joseph ejercito estrada president philippines congress session hall house representatives ang pangalawang pangulo ng republika ng pilipinas kagalanggalang na pangulo ng senado kagalanggalang na speaker ng mababang kapulungan kagalanggalang na punong hukom ng korte suprema kagalanggalang na mga miyembro ng kongreso ng pilipinas kagalanggalang na mga kagawad ng mga gabinete excellencies diplomatic corps mga piling panauhin mga minamahal kong mga kababayan noong mayo onse mahigit na milyong pilipino ang nagdesisyon na pamunuan natin ang bansa patungo sa bagong milenyo ngayon sila ang nagtatanong ano ba ang gagawin ng bagong pamunuang ito upang ihatid ang ating bansa sa bagong siglo today stand accounting present road map future paano ba tayo itatawid sa krisis na nakabalot sa ating ekonomiya nasaan na ba tayo ngayon saan ba tayo nanggaling saan ba tayo patutungo hindi na ako magpapaliguyligoy nasa harap tayo ngayon ng matinding krisis na gumugulo sa buong asya ayon sa mga eksperto wala pa tayo sa pinakamalubhang yugto ng krisis kung babalewalain natin ang kinalalagyan natin ngayon tiyak na lulubog ang ating bansa sa bigat ng ganap ng recession malubha ang lagay ng ating ekonomiya namimiligro ang kabangyaman ng bansa ngunit hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang pamahalaan lalong hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang sambayanang pilipino sawa na ang taumbayan sa mga walangkabuluhang pangakot palabas sa harap ng matinding krisis na ating pinagdaanan nitong nakaraang taon ang kailangan natiy mga mabilis mabisang lunas ito ang matinding hamon na dapat nating tugunan—tayong lahat ang panguluhan ang kongreso ang pribadong sektor ang mamamayan mabigat ang hamon na ito—subalit buo ang tiwala kong mas matimbang ang pinagsama nating talino sipag kakayahan let us first make accounting present true accounting perhaps long overdue nitong unang bahagi ng ang paglago ng gross domestic product ay katumbas lamang sa percent ng antas na naitala noong nangalahati ang produksyon ng mga pabrika natin pawang pagbabawas ng imbentaryo—at hindi ang paglikha ng mga produkto—ang ginawa ng mga industriya natin sa kanilang pangangamba sa recession lalo lamang pinalala ang problema bumagsak ang ating produksyong pangagrikultura bumaba nang percent ang ani ng palay bumaba din nang percent ang ani ng mais malimit nating tukuyin ang phenomenon ng el niño subalit ang tunay na ugat ng suliranin ay ang pangkalahatang sektor ng agrikultura halos doubledigit na ang ating inflation rate napakataas ang interes na sinisingil ng mga bangko kaya naman hindi makautang ang marami nating negosyante lalo namang hinigpitan ng mga bangko ang kanilang pagpapautang kayat maraming kalakal ang nagsasara dahil sa debalwasyon sa el niño tuluytuloy ang pagbagsak ng ating piso ito ay lubhang mabigat para sa ating mga kababayan natin na isang kahig isang tuka ang kinagisnang pamumuhay unemployment percent still growing underemployment percent also growing million filipinos need job twice number wish real fulltime job maaaring sabihing ito ay maliit pa subalit paano mo sasabihin sa pamilyang gutom na mas masama ang kalagayan ng ibang pamilya sa ibang bansa one lost job one hungry family one cold statistic cannot agree statistics claim number poor people gone past decade wonder people believe statistics wala sa akin ang mga statistics na iyan poor poor—walang pera walang pagkain walang bubong walang dignidad lalunglalo na walang pagasa hindi lang iyan yung mayaman ay higit pang yumaman ang mahihirap lalong humirap wish could say shall set job security fund soon dont want add inventory unfunded laws bills amount billion worth promises never fulfilled according statistics past six years philippine economy grew richest percent got percent national income poorest percent wala pang dalawang porsiyento worse countryside percent filipinos still work onethird wages city come find jobs none qualify noong araw inakala ko na marami na kusang darating sa ating bansa ang mga banyagang negosyante dahil ang mga manggagawa natin ay mahuhusay handang tumanggap ng mababang sahod hindi na ito totoo napakababa ng productivity ng karaniwang manggagawang pilipino dahil kalahati na lang sa kanila ang nakapagtapos sa mababang paaralan samantalang tatlumput tatlong porsiyento lang ang nakaabot ng high school ngunit limitado ang pondo na maari nating ilaan para sa edukasyon may kakulangan tayong silidaralan guro hindi lamang sa larangan ng edukasyon—hanggang ngayon mahigit sa tatlumpung porsiyento ng tahanan sa bansa ay wala pa ring kuryente sa boung asya sunod lamang sa bansang hapon ang taas ng singil natin sa kuryente sa larangan ng agrarian reform na ngayon ay nasa na taon na percent target areas distributed productivity become lower mean land left landlords farmers left fend add anarchy peace order front thing organized crime thing systematic kidnapping result capital flight yet officials think attract foreign funds tax incentives potential kidnap victims ang sinumang bagong pangulo ay may pangarap minimithing para sa bansa lalunglalo na sa akin na malaki ang inaasahan ng masang pilipino ngunit gustuhin ko man na maibigay ang kanilang inaasahan sa lalong madaling panahon paano ko ibibigay kung wala tayong sapat na pananalapi na igugugol para maiangat ang kanilang kabuhayan billion budget deficit consolidated public sector deficit could go high billion collection taxes duties even tax exemptions incentives cut deep government revenues government could borrow raise interest rates worsen economic slowdown result less taxes fewer jobs high interest rates squeeze gnp two percent half million jobless pressure bangko sentral print money inflation shoot kaliwat kanan may latay napakahirap tumimbang sadyang malala ang problema natin gayunpaman nasa ugat ng problema ang nakikita kong solusyon problems face magnitude require nothing less heroic concerted action must move upon single community bound together common rules agree respect obey begin reduce cost governance costs go higher higher corrupt act wasteful project bilyunbilyong piso ang nawawaldas sa mga proyektong maaksaya

ang mga palabas kailangan magbanat tayo ng mgabuto tunay na serbisyo ang siyang dapat na maging balangkas para sa ating mga solusyon ngayon taon mula sa inaasahang bilyon pababa sa bilyon lamang kailangang magsagawa ng mga kaukulang pagbabago pagtitipid ang pamahalaan upang lalo pang paliitin ang inaasahang kakulangan nito sa bilyon lamang order achieve targets resolutely pursue several major

uulitin ko isang balita lang tungkol sa katiwalian ipatitigil ko ang anumang klase ng subasta kahit sino pa sila ordered inventory government lands titled departments bureaus transfer national

government although tolerate certain amount deficit year try best possible pursue balanced budget national government coming years consolidated deficit entire public sector limited percent countrys gnp makikinabang ang lahat sa mga gagawin nating ito hindi lamang ang pamahalaan kundi ang karaniwang mamamayan na rin sa larangan ng ating financial system patuloy na igagalang ng aking administrasyon ang kalayaan ng ating monetary board ng bangko sentral ng pilipinas subalit hindi kailangang magdusa ng lubos ang kalakalan sa patuloy na pagtaas ng interest rates kakatigan ko ang pagbaba ng interest ang pagpapabilis sa daloy ng pananalapi lalo na sa mga maliliit na negosyo gayunpaman titiyakin kong ang salapi ng mga government financial institution ay hindi sosolohin ng mga iilang korporasyon giant corporations powerful groups cornered huge chunk resources government banks whose mandate principally help agriculture small medium enterprises practice reversed sobra na ang kanilang pagsasamantala billionaires pushed small borrowers lending windows charge much higher interest rates time gfis truly sincerely service common peoples needs ipinamalas din ng kasalukuyang krisis ang peligro ng labis na pagasa sa mga pondong nagmumula sa labas kayat kailangan nating pagibayuhin ang sarili nating pagiipon nang may sarili tayong pampuhunan sa ating mga proyekto sa dako naman tayo ng agrikultura na lubhang napabayaan kayat ang food security ng milyong pilipino ay nasa bingit ng alanganin monopoly rice importation national food authority stabilized prices broken cartels two administrations declared sugar sunset industry doomed die maybe know sunset industry cannot leave three million families depend sugar dark nothing eat sun goes marahil ang paglubog ng ating agrikultura ay dulot ng kulang na imprastruktura hindi sapat ang bilang ng mga daanan na naguugnay sa mga bukid mga pamilihan bakit nga ba magtatanim kung hindi mo naman maibebenta ang iyong inani condoning irrigation fees ibibigay natin ng libre ang patubig sa ating magsasaka time launch fullscale program based costeffective irrigation technologies kailangan nating gumawa ng kilometro ng mga bagong daan magkakahalaga ito ng billion without graft corruption money well spent could also jumpstart economy tungkol naman sa ating kapaligiran ipapairal natin ang ganap na pagbabawal sa pagtotroso total log ban maglulunsad tayo ng bagong programa sa muling pagtatanim ng mga puno like past massive reforestation another excuse massive corruption traffic tells us need roads need finish faster one reason delay roads projects issuance temporary restraining orders tros interfere judiciary urge supreme court remind judges lawyers oath delay man money masyado ng garapal ang bentahan ng temporary restraining order walang lakas ang mahihirap upang tulungan ang kanilang sarili ngunit ngayon kahit ang gobyerno ay kapos sa pondo must strategize maximize doleouts basic social services right means basic health care basic nutrition useful education want cannot afford speed program establish one science high school every province give education subsidies straight deserving students teachers without passing schools way choose study teach ang lahat ng mga ito ay nangangailangan ng salapi sa mga susunod na hakbangin kailangan lamang natin ang tapang political nilagdaan ko na ang executive order na lumilikha sa tinaguriang presidential task force organized crime bunga nito katakuttakot na batikos ang ipinukol sa akin isang tanong isang sagot kontra ba tayo sa krimen sa mga lulmalaban sa krimen task force think needed hit crime hit hard put out—decisively maybe better way one shown say wrong right effectively sawa na ako sa kanila pati na ang mamamayan sawa na rin sawa na sa puro pamumulitika sawa na sa puro salita ngunit wala namang nagagawa kundi laitin ang mga lumalaban sa krimen buo na ang aking pasiya tuloy ang presidential task force criminals propose congress amends dangerous drug act eliminate possibility probation offenders even say sorry place drug dealer addict together jail shall propose another controversial measure want devolve greater administrative control philippine national police local government units sure get hit also perhaps constitutional question one thing sure abusing power sharing power local executives national police ang pulis na baon sa hirap ay hindi nalalayo sa tukso na mangabuso pero hindi ako nagdududa na gagampanan nang tapat ng mga alagad ng batas ang kanilang tungkulin kahit na gaano pa silang kahirap ngunit bakit pa natin pabibigatin ang kanilang kalagayan naniniwala ako na kapag sapat ang sahod ng ating mga alagad ng batas higit na magiging propesyonal ang ating mga pulisya sa krimen ang sagot natin ay kaparusahan sa rebelyon ang tugon natin ay negosasyon sa mga nagsisialsa ay tapat lamang ang pagnanasa na makamit ang pagbabago sa lipunan tayo ay handang makipagnegosasyon subalit sa mga terorista wala tayong panahon sa mga kapatid nating muslim hinihiling ko ang pagkakataon na mabigyan ng katarungan ang napakaraming taon ng kapabayaan tigilan natin ang dahas pagibayuhin ang sandugong kapatiran samantalang ang karapatan ng ating mga kababaihan ay patuloy nating itataguyod president inherit problems responsibility finish predecessors started includes resolution illgotten wealth cases marcos era talked settlements precluded continuing prosecution yet cases gone long enough therefore order presidential commission good government go forward illgotten wealth cases evidence taken long years collect delays one way another want cases end one year final judgments acceptable settlements pagkatapos ng taon siguro naman may katibayan na upang mabigyan ng katarungan ang sambayanang pilipino ito ang maliwanag na halimbawa ng justice delayed justice denied sa dakong external security naman effective national defense requires modern weaponry better fighting men spend expensive hardware let us right kind soldiers weapons win wars men fight develop credible military deterrent must depend goodwill neighbors treaty commitments united states skills diplomats conveying everyone want peace stability shared prosperity said stand senator us bases treaty disqualifies president endorsing visiting forces agreement united states contrary stood philippine sovereignty president moral right stand philippine security today sa bahagi naman ng pamamahala itinatag ang pamahalaan upang paglingkuran ang mga mamamayan—at hindi ang kanyang sarili kung tutuusin kailangan natin ng higit pang pamamahala—lalo na upang itaguyod ang kapakanan ng mga maralita sa ngayon labislabis ang ating pamamahala subalit kulang na kulang naman ang mga serbisyong pampubliko pakikiusapan ko ang kongreso na bigyan ako ng kapangyarihan para reorganisahin ang gobyerno upang ito ay maging matipid masinop aim change officials rationalize government operations small country small government national also local level tungkol naman sa ating electoral reforms hindi lamang halalang mapayapa ang ating kailangan kundi kampanyang hindi lubhang magastos hindi lamang karapatan ng mga mamamayang bumoto ang dapat natin tiyakin dapat siguruhin natin na ang mga boto nila ay mabibilang upang makamit ito kailangan bigyan ang komisyon sa halalan ng higit pang kapangyarihan upang harangin parusahan ang lahat ng uri ng pandaraya hinihiling ko sa kongreso na magpatibay ng batas upang gawing heinous crime ang anumang electoral fraud kailangan matapos ang computerization program bago sumapit ang susunod na eleksiyon natitiyak kong marami pa tayong magagawa sa ikabubuti ng pangangasiwa ng pamahalaan—ngunit maaring kailangan pang baguhin ang ilang mga alituntunin ng saligang batas darating ang panahon ng pagbabago sa ating saligang batas mga kagalanggalang ng kinatawan ng sambayanang pilipino hayaan ninyong wakasan ko ang mensaheng ito sa pagsambit ng isang taimtim na pagasa ngayong taon—sa kabila ng mga mabibigat na suliranin—sumusulong pa rin ang ating ekonomiya year despite formidable odds still expect economic growth gross national product targeted expand year percent countries region registered negative gnp continue positive growth—this would say credit predecessor former president ramos believe keep inflation based prices single digits around percent conclude aim help country escape recession solutions obvious proposals may commonplace never adapted sum spend wisely less austerity hard work generate means cover shortfalls past smooth runway final takeoff perhaps six years passed someone else take pilot honored enough elected position highest responsibility power trust land neither pretensions ambition sincere desire serve help least people kaya po akoy humihingi sa inyo ng kaunting pagunawa kaunting panahon kaunting pagtitiis alangalang sa ating bayan higit sa lahat para sa ating nakakaraming mahihirap na mamamayan naniniwala ako na kapag nagawa natin na tayoy nagkaisa tayoy nagkasamasama lahat ng klaseng pagsubok ay malalampasan natin nandiyan din ang ating hamon nandiyan din ang ating tagumpay maraming maraming salamat po,Estrada-1998
