now the democracy that was taken from us by force was reclaimed peacefully and in so doing we brought light to a dark chapter in our history let it not be forgotten martial law was borne because a dictator manipulated the constitution to remain in power and to this day the battle rages between those who seek a more equitable system and those who seek to preserve their privileges at the expense of others the specters of a lost decade haunted us from our first day in office there was the north rail contract—an expensive project that became even more expensive after renegotiation ironically the higher cost came with fewer public benefits a fleet of  train sets was reduced to three and the number of stations from five to two to make matters worse the debts incurred from the project are now being called in we had goccs handing out unwarranted bonuses despite the losses already suffered by their agencies we had the billions wasted by pagcor on—of all things—coffee we had the suspect management practices of the pnp which involved ignoring the need to arm the remaining  percent of our police force just to collect kickbacks on rundown helicopters purchased at brandnew prices  we were left with little fiscal space even as debts had bunched up and were maturing we were also left a long list of obligations to fulfill a backlog of  classrooms which would cost us about  billion pesos a backlog of  classroom chairs amounting to  billion pesos in  an estimated  million filipinos were still not members of philhealth fortytwo billion pesos was needed to enroll them add to all this the  billion pesos needed for the modernization of our armed forces to fulfill all these obligations and address all our needs we were bequeathed at the start of our term  percent of the entire

what we had at the beginning of our term this is a longterm project with farreaching impact the research is in its initial stages but already the figures show promise based on data from the dswd  mothers now get regular checkups  children have been vaccinated against diarrhea polio measles and various other diseases  million students no longer need to miss school because of poverty when we first took office only  percent of filipinos were enrolled in philhealth enrollment was not necessarily based on need but on being in the good graces of politicians now  percent of our citizens are members this means that since we received our mandate  million more filipinos have access to philhealths array of benefits and services and heres even better news the  million poorest households identified by our national household targeting system will now fully benefit from philhealths programs free of charge because of the department of healths no balance billing policy treatment for dengue pneumonia asthma cataracts—as well as treatments for catastrophic diseases like breast cancer prostate cancer and acute leukemia—can be availed of for free by our poorest countrymen the process for our poorest philhealth members enter any government hospital show your philhealth card get treatment and they return to their homes without having to shell out a single centavo one of the briefings i attended noted that four out of ten filipinos have never seen a health professional in their entire lifetime other figures are more dire six out of ten filipinos die without being attended to by health professionals but whatever the basis the number of filipinos with no access to government health services remains a concern and we are acting on this in  ten thousand nurses and midwives were deployed under the rnheals program to date we have deployed  add to this over  community health teams tasked to strengthen the links between doctors and nurses and the communities they serve and today because of efficient targeting they are deployed to where they are most needed to areas that have been for so long left in the margins of society we have sent our health professionals to  localities covered by the pantawid pamilya and to the  poorest cities and municipalities as identified by the national antipoverty commission this new system addresses two issues thousands of nurses and midwives now have jobs and an opportunity to gain valuable work experience at the same time millions of our countrymen now have increased access to quality health care but we are not satisfied with this what we want true universal and holistic health care this begins not in our hospitals but within each and every household increased consciousness routine inoculation and regular checkups are necessary to keep sickness at bay add to this our efforts to ensure that we prevent the illnesses that are in our power to prevent for example last year i told you about our antidengue mosquito traps it is too early to claim total victory our scientists are rigorous about testing but the initial results have been very encouraging we tested the efficacy of those mosquito traps in areas with the

want universal health care we want our medical institutions to have enough equipment facilities and manpower we can easily fulfill all these goals if the sin tax bill—which rationalizes taxes on alcohol and tobacco products—can be passed this bill makes vice more expensive while at the same time raising more money for health and what of our students—what welcomes them in the schools will they still first learn the alphabet beneath the shade of a tree will they still be squatting on the floor tussling with classmates over a single textbook i have great faith in secretary luistro before the

own set of books then look them straight in the eye and tell them i do not want you to go to school if you take issue with the fact that  million of the countrys poorest households can now avail of quality healthcare services without worrying about the cost then look them straight in the eye and tell them i do not want you to get better if it angers you that three million filipino families have been empowered to fulfill their dreams because of pantawid pamilya then look them straight in the eye and tell them i will take away the hope you now have for your future the era where policy was based on the whims of the powerful has truly come to an end for example the previous leadership of tesda generously distributed scholarship vouchers—but neglected to fund them naturally the vouchers bounced the result over a thousand schools are charging the government  billion pesos for the vouchers one person and one administration wanted to show off the filipino people are paying for that now when secretary joel villanueva assumed the post he was not daunted by the seemingly impossible reforms that his agency needed to enact despite the staggering debt inherited by tesda it still trained  individuals under the training for work scholarship program the tesda specialists technopreneurship program likewise delivered concrete victories—imagine each of the  certified specialistas are earning  pesos a day or  pesos a month this is higher than the minimum wage from infancy to adolescence to adulthood the system is working for our citizens and we are ensuring that our economys newfound vitality generates jobs let us keep in mind there are about a million new entrants to the job market every year the jobs we have produced within the past two years total almost  million as a result our unemployment rate is declining steadily in  the unemployment rate was at  percent in april  it dropped to  and dropped further to  this year is it not an apt time for us to dream of a day where any filipino who wishes to work can find a job look at the bpo sector back in the year  only  people were employed in this industry fast forward to   people are employed by bpos and the industry has contributed  billion dollars to our eco',\n",
       "  'nomy it has been projected that come  the year i will bid you farewell it will be bringing in  billion dollars and will be employing  million filipinos and this does not include the estimated  million taxi drivers baristas corner stores canteens and many others that will benefit from the indirect jobs that the bpo industry will create a large portion of our jobgeneration strategy is building sufficient infrastructure for those who have gone to boracay on vacation you have probably seen our newly christened terminal in caticlan the plan to expand its runway has also been laid out and we will not stop there before the end of my term the new bohol airport in panglao new legaspi airport in daraga and laguindingan airport in misamis oriental will have been built we will also upgrade our international airports in mactan cebu tacloban and puerto princesa airport so they can receive more passengers in addition to remodeling the airports in butuan cotabato dipolog pagadian tawitawi southern leyte and san vicente in palawan i am the fourth president to deal with the problems of naia terminal  airplanes are not all that take off and land here so did problems and anomalies secretary mar roxas has already said before we convene at the next sona the structural defects we inherited in naia  will have been fully repaired this june the lrt line  cavite extension project began to move forward when completed it will alleviate traffic in las piñas parañaque and cavite in addition to this in order to further improve traffic in metro manila there will be two elevated roads directly connecting the north luzon and south luzon expressways these will be completed in  and will reduce travel time between clark and calamba to  hour and  minutes before i leave office there will be highquality terminals in taguig quezon city and parañaque so that provincial buses will no longer have to add to the traffic on edsa perceptions have also changed about a department formerly notorious for its inadequacies i still remember the days when during the rainy season the tarlac river would overflow and submerge the macarthur highway the asphalt would melt away the road would be riddled with potholes until it ended up impassable as the representative of my district i registered my complaints about this the department of public works and highways reply we know about the problem we know how to solve it but we have no money i had to appeal to my barangays if we dont prioritize and spend for this ourselves no one will fix it and we will be the ones who suffer back in those days everyone called upon the government to wake up and start working the complaints today are different traffic is terrible but thats because theres so much roadwork being done may i remind everyone we have done all this without raising taxes we will not build our road network based on kickbacks or favoritism we will build them according to a clear system now that resources for these projects are no longer allocated haphazardly our plans will no longer end up unfulfilled—they will become tangible roads that benefit the filipino people when we assumed office  kilometers of our national roads were not yet fixed right now  kilometers of this has been fixed under the leadership of secretary babes singson in  an additional  kilometers will be finished we are even identifying and fixing dangerous roads with the use of modern technology these are challenges we will continue to address every year so that before the end of my term every inch of our national road network will be fixed we have fixed more than just roads our dpwh has fixed its system just by following the right process of bidding and procurement their agency saved a total of  billion pesos from  to june of this year even our contractors are feeling the positive effects of our reforms in dpwh according to the dpwh the top  contractors are now fully booked i am hopeful that the development of our infrastructure continues unimpeded to facilitate the growth of our other industries the improvement of our infrastructure is intertwined with the growth of our tourism industry consider this in  the philippines recorded  million tourist arrivals when we assumed office in  this figure had grown to only around  million take note despite the length of their time in office the previous administration only managed to add a mere  million tourist arrivals—and we contributed half a year to that number under our administration we welcomed  million tourist arrivals by june  more will arrive during peak season before the end of the year so i have no doubt that we will meet our quota of  million tourist arrivals for  this means that we will have a yearonyear increase of  million tourists the bottom line in two years we would have had a bigger growth in tourist arrivals compared to the increase charted by the previous administration in their nine years we are not singing our own praises we are merely stating the truth but secretary mon jimenez is still not satisfied he says if  million tourists came to malaysia in  and around  million visited thailand would it be too farfetched to have ten million tourists visiting the philippines',\n",
       "  ' annually by  and if the filipino people continue to embody the same solidarity that allowed the puerto princesa underground river to become one of the new seven wonders of nature there is no doubt that we will be able to achieve this as we have already announced to the entire world its more fun in the philippines secretary mon jimenez has been at his post for less than a year but we are already reaping the fruits of the reforms we have laid down so when it comes to tourism we are confident in saying its really more fun—to have secretary mon jimenez with us when it comes to growth and development agriculture is at the top of our priorities secretary alcala has been working nonstop to deliver us good news before it seemed as though the officials of the da cultivated nothing but nfas debts the nfa that our predecessors took over had a  peso debt when they left office they then bequeathed to us a debt of  billion pesos for so long in the past we were led to believe that we were short  million metric tons of rice and that we needed to import  million metric tons to address this shortage they ordered rice as if it was unlimited—but because we had exceeded far more than what we needed imported rice went to rot in the warehouses in just our first year we reduced the annual shortage of  million metric tons to just  metric tons this year it is down to —including a buffer stock to dip into in times of calamity and if the weather cooperates well be able to export rice next year secretary alcala has said that key to our success is a feasible irrigation program and the assiduous implementation of the certified seeds program what is galling is that this knowledge is not new—it simply wasnt applied if they had only done their jobs right where could we have been by now look at our coconut industry coconut water once treated as a waste product is now being utilized by our farmers from  liters exported in  to  liters in  to a staggering  liters of cocowater exported in  and where no one previously paid heed to coconut coir we are now experiencing a shortage due to the high demand of exporters we are not wasting this opportunity we are buying the machines that will process the coco fibers we have allocated  billion pesos to invest in and develop this sector my mother initiated the comprehensive agrarian reform program it is only just that this program sees its conclusion during my term we are improving the system so that we can more swiftly and more efficiently realize agrarian reform the government is doing everything in its power to ensure that our farmers can claim as their own the land they have tilled and nurtured with their sweat there are those however who wish to obstruct us i say to them we will obey the law the law says the nation says and i say before i step down all the land covered by carp will have been distributed let me shed some light on our advances in the energy sector in the past an electrical wire needed only to reach the barangay hall for an entire barangay to be deemed energized this was the pretext for the claim that  percent of the countrys barangays had electricity even the delivery of so basic a service was a deception we challenged doe and nea allocating  billion pesos to light up an initial target of  sitios at the cost of one million pesos per sitio and the agencies met the challenge—they lit up  sitios at a total cost of  million pesos they accomplished this in three months instead of the two years it took the people that preceded them secretary rene almendras i give you credit you never seem to run out of energy with public service you are not only everready but like an energizer bunny too—you keep on going and going and going we have suffused the nation with light—and it is this light too that has exposed the crimes that occur in the shadowed corners of society what the filipino works so hard for can no longer be pilfered crime volume continues to decline across the country in  over  crimes were recorded—this year we have cut that number by more than half to  moreover s recorded  cases of carnapping has likewise been reduced by half—to  cases this  it is these facts that we hope will be bannered in headlines we do not claim that we have ended criminality but im sure no one would complain that it has been reduced in the span of just a little more than a year havent we finally put raymond dominguez in jail after years of\\xa0 being in and out of prison charges have been filed against two of his brothers as well and they are now serving time too of the two suspects in the makati bus bombing of the past year—one is dead and the other is living in a jail cell he shares the same fate as the more than ten thousand individuals arrested by pdea in  for charges relating to illegal drugs pacquiao does not fight every day and so we cant rely on him to bring down the crime rate that is why were strengthening our police force when this administration began  percent of our police carried no guns and probably relied on magic charms as they chased criminals but now we have completed the bidding—and we are now testing the quality—for an order of  guns which we will provide our police so that',\n",
       "  ' they may better serve and protect the nation our communities and themselves let us now talk about national defense some have described our air force as all air and no force lacking the proper equipment our troops remain vulnerable even as they are expected to be put in harms way we cannot allow things to remain this way after only one year and seven months we have been able to allocate over  billion pesos for the afp modernization program this will soon match the  billion pesos set aside for the program in the past  years and were only getting started if our proposed afp modernization bill is passed in congress we will be able to allocate  billion pesos for defense within the next five years the  dollar fund entrusted to us by the united states for the defense capability upgrade and sustainment of equipment program of the afp is now ready as well this is in addition to their assistance in improving the way we patrol our shores under the coast watch center of the philippines which will soon be established at this moment the armed forces is likewise canvassing equipment such as cannons personnel carriers and frigates before long the brp ramon alcaraz our second hamilton class cutter will drop anchor to partner with the brp gregorio del pilar we will no longer send paper boats out to sea now our  kilometers of coastline will be patrolled by more modern ships and perhaps it is an apt time for our armed forces to clean up their hangars because we will be having equipment arriving soon to further fortify our defenses finally our one and only  that has been roaming our skies for the past  years will have partners two more  will once again be operational before this year ends we are hopeful that the twentyone refurbished  helicopters the four combat utility helicopters the radios and other communication equipment the rifles the mortars the mobile diagnostic laboratories and even the station bullet assemblies we have purchased will be delivered come  ten attack helicopters two naval helicopters two light aircraft one frigate and air force protection equipment will also be arriving and it is not only through better equipment that we demonstrate our commitment to help our police and our soldiers we have eased their financial burdens through the  houses that have been built under the afp–pnp housing program we are not doing this because we want to be an aggressor we are not doing this because we want escalation this is about keeping the peace this is about protecting ourselves—something that we have long thought impossible this is about the life of a soldier who risks his life every day this is about his family who awaits his safe return despite the challenges that confront him lets listen to some of the beneficiaries of these programs tell us in their own words how their lives have been changed  we thank the lord god for giving us this opportunity and these blessings also because we have such a good president through these projects we know he has the wellbeing of our armed forces and law enforcers at heart –  domingo medalla  were doing our best to get by and im doing my best to get my kids to go to school thats my only mission in life to give my kids a proper education so that they will do right in the world they need good parenting for that im thankful for the conditional cash transfer program i learned a lot from it – eva neri  its a great help that our family is one of—if im not mistaken one of the first—beneficiaries of the category z package of philhealth im so thankful for this my child getting sick is not something to look forward to but if that happens philhealth will be there to ease the burden – kristine tatualla  i was one of the participants of the oakwood mutiny the change that is happening today its what weve been fighting for these days because of president aquinos housing program its possible for us to own our own homes – pfc rolly bernal   now that the people care for them the more impassioned our soldiers are in winning the peace we consider the  outlaws whose violence has come to an end a great triumph one example is the infamous terrorist doctor abu who will never again strike fear in the hearts of our countrymen we also celebrate the peace and quiet that has returned to places where our countrymen were once deafened by gunfire as a result of our solidarity  barangays have been liberated from the enemy  buildings and schools have been repaired and  health centers have been built while we are on the subject of peace let us talk about a place that has long stood as a symbol of frustrated hopes before our reforms in the armm began what we had were ghost students walking to ghost schools on ghost roads to learn from ghost teachers some of the apparitions that haunted oic governor mujiv hataman four schools found with ghost students we are also investigating the teachers whose names do not appear in the list of the professional regulation commission as well as the government workers not listed in the plantilla fiftyfive ghost entries have been taken off the payroll the previous scheme of regraveling roads again and again just to earn money has been outlawed to avoid abuse we ha',\n",
       "  've ended cash advances for agencies now the souls of the ghosts in voters lists can rest in peace this is why to oic governor mujiv hataman we can say to you you are indeed a certified ghost buster what we have replaced these phantoms with real housing bridges and learning centers for badjaos in basilan communitybased hatcheries nets materials to grow seaweeds and seedlings that have benefited  fishermen certified seeds gabi seedlings cassava rubber and trees that are bearing fruit for  farmers and this is only the beginning  million pesos has been set aside for the fire stations  million pesos for clean drinking water  million pesos for healthcare equipment  million pesos for daycare centers and  billion pesos for the roads and bridges across the region these are just some of the things that will be afforded by the aggregate  billion pesos the national government has granted the armm also allow me to clarify this does not include the yearly support that they receive which in  reached  billion pesos even those who previously wanted to break away are seeing the effects of reform over the past seven months not even a single encounter has been recorded between the military and the milf we recognize this as a sign of their trust with regard to the peace process talks have been very open both sides have shown trust and faith in one another there may be times when the process can get a little complicated but these are merely signs that we are steadily moving closer to our shared goal peace we likewise engaged stakeholders in a levelheaded discussion in crafting our executive order on mining the idea behind our consensus we reached that we be able to utilize our natural resources to uplift the living conditions of the filipinos not just of today but also of the following generations\\xa0we will not reap the rewards of this industry if the cost is the destruction of nature but this executive order is only the first step think about it in   billion pesos was the total value derived from mining but only  billion or  percent went to the national treasury these natural resources are yours it shouldnt happen that all thats left to you is a tip after theyre extracted we are hoping that congress will work with us and pass a law that will ensure that the environment is cared for and that the public and private sectors will receive just benefits from this industry let us talk about the situation in disaster risk reduction and management once the government which is supposed to give aid was the one asking for aid today even when the storm is still brewing we already know how to craft clear plans to avoid catastrophe talking about disasters reminds me of the time when a typhoon struck tarlac the dike collapsed due to the rains when one of the barangay captains awoke the floods had already taken his house as well as his farming equipment fortunately the entire family survived but the carabao they had left tied to a tree wasnt as lucky it was strangled to death from the force of the flood many of those affected by typhoons ondoy pepeng and sendong were just as defenseless we lost so many lives to these natural disasters and now through project noah all our antidisaster initiatives have been brought inside one boat and we no longer leave the evacuation of families up to mere luck we now have the technology to give fair warning to filipinos in order to prepare for and avoid the worst our  automated rain gauges and  water level monitoring sensors in various regions now benefit us directly and in realtime our target before the end of   automated rain gauges and  water level sensors we will have them installed in  primary river basins around the country yet another change before agencies with shared responsibilities would work separately with little coordination or cooperation now the culture of government is bayanihan—a coming together for the sake of the people this is what we call convergence there have always been tree planting programs in government—but after the trees have been planted they were left alone communities that needed livelihood would cut these down and turn them into charcoal we have the solution for this  hectares of forest have been planted across the country this is only a fraction of the  millionhectare farmlands to be laid out before we step down this covers the communities under the national convergence initiative the process when a tree is planted the dwsd will coordinate with communities in exchange for a conditional cash transfer communities would take care of the trees some would help nurture seeds in a nursery  individuals now earn their livelihood from these activities the private sector has likewise taken part in a program that hands out special coffee and cacao beans to communities and trains the townsfolk too to nurture those seeds into a bountiful harvest the coffee is planted in the shade of the trees that in turn help prevent flooding and protect the people the company that hands out the seeds are sure buyers of the yield its a winwin situation—for the private sector the communities with their extra income and the succeeding generations that will benefit from the trees illegal',\n",
       "  ' logging has long been a problem from the time we signed executive order no  mayor jun amante has confiscated lumber amounting to more than six million pesos he has our gratitude this is just in butuan what more if all our lgus demonstrated the same kind of political will  the timber confiscated by denr are handed over to tesda which then gives the timber to communities they train in carpentry from this deped gets chairs for our public schools consider this what was once the product of destruction has been crafted into an instrument for the realization of a better future this was impossible then—impossible so long as the government turned a blind eye to illegal activities to those of you without a conscience those of you who repeatedly gamble the lives of your fellow filipinos—your days are numbered weve already sanctioned thirtyfour denr officials one pnp provincial director and seven chiefs of police we are asking a regional director of the pnp to explain why he seemed deaf to our directives and blind to the colossal logs that were being transported before his very eyes if you do not shape up you will be next even if you tremble beneath the skirts of your patrons we will find you i suggest that you start doing your jobs before its too late from the womb to school to work change has touched the filipino and should a life of government service be chosen our people can expect the same level of care from the state until retirement our administration will recognize their contributions to our society as public servants and will not withhold from them the pensions they themselves contributed to consider some retirees receive less than  pesos a month how does one pay for water power and food daily our response with the new year comes our resolution that all oldage and disability pensioners will receive no less than five thousand pesos monthly we are heartened that we can meet their needs now without jeopardizing their future benefits the face of government has truly changed our compensation levels are at par with the private sectors at the entry level but as you rise through the ranks privatesector pay overtakes the government we will close that gap in time for now we have good news for government employees performancebased incentives in the past even poorly performing agencies would not have any employees with ratings lower than very satisfactory to maintain smooth interpersonal relations supervisors would have a hard time giving appropriate ratings exceptional employees are not recognized their excellence is deincentivized and receive the same rewards as laziness and indolence here is one of our steps to respond to this starting this year we will implement a system in which bonuses are based on their agencys abilities to meet their annual targets employees now hold the keys to their own advancement incentives may reach up to  pesos depending on how well you do your jobs this is in addition to your acrosstheboard christmas bonus we are doing this not only to boost morale and to show due appreciation of our public servants this is above all for the filipino people who expect sincere and efficient service—who expect that they will continue to be the sole bosses of our workers in government there have always been people who have questioned our guiding principle if there is no corruption there is no poverty they ask if good governance can put food on the table quite simply yes think about it doing business in the philippines was once considered too risky—the rules were too opaque and they were constantly changing a person shaking your hand one day may pick your pocket the next now with a level playing field and clear and consistent rules confidence in our economy is growing investments are pouring in jobs are being created and a virtuous cycle has begun—where empowered consumers buy more products and businesses hire more people so they can expand to keep up with the growing demand prudent spending has allowed us to plug the leaks in the system and improved tax collection has increased revenues every peso collected is properly spent on roads on vaccines on classrooms and chairs—spent on our future we have fixed the system by which we build roads bridges and buildings—they now go where they are truly needed our roads are properly paved products services and people reach their destination quickly and with greater ease because of good governance in agriculture food production has increased prices dont fluctuate wages are stable and our economy is stronger it is true a resilient and dynamic economy resting on the foundations of good governance is the best defense against global uncertainty we have been dismantling the obstacles to progress for two years and now our success can only be limited by how hard we are willing to work for it we achieved all these things even as countries around the world were surmounting their own challenges we exist in this world with others and so it is only appropriate that even as we attend to our own problems we remain vigilant about some events that affect us the situation in bajo de masinloc has been the source of much discussion chinese fishermen entered our terri',\n",
       "  'tory our patrol boats intercepted some of their ships which contain endangered species as your leader it is my duty to uphold the laws of our country and as i did tension ensued on one hand the chinese had their ninedash line theory laying claim to almost the entire west philippine sea on the other there was the united nations convention on the laws of the sea which recognized the rights of many countries including that of china itself we demonstrated utmost forbearance in dealing with this issue as a sign of our goodwill we replaced our navy cutter with a civilian boat as soon as we could we chose not to respond to their medias harangues i do not think it excessive to ask that our rights be respected\\xa0 just as we respect their rights as a fellow nation in a world we need to share there are those who say that we should let bajo de masinloc go we should avoid the trouble but if someone entered your yard and told you he owned it would you agree would it be right to give away that which is rightfully ours and so i ask for solidarity from our people regarding this issue let us speak with one voice help me relay to the other side the logic of our stand this is not a simple situation and there can be no simple solutions rest assured we are consulting experts every leader of our nation our allies—even those on the other side—to find a resolution that is acceptable to all with every step on the straight and righteous path we plant the seeds of change but there are still some who are committed to uprooting our work even as i speak there are those who have gathered in a room whispering to each other dissecting each word i utter looking for any pretext to attack me with tomorrow these are also the ones who say let go of the past unite forgive and forget so we can move forward as a people i find this unacceptable shall we simply forgive and forget the ten years that were taken from us do we simply forgive and forget the farmers who piled up massive debts because of a government that insisted on importing rice while we could have reinvested in them and their farmlands instead shall we forgive and forget the family of the police officer who died while trying to defend himself against guns with nothing but a nightstick shall we forgive and forget the orphans of the  victims of the massacre in maguindanao will their loved ones be brought back to life by forgiving and forgetting do we forgive and forget everything that was ever done to us to sink us into a rotten state do we forgive and forget to return to the former status quo my response forgiveness is possible forgetting is not if offenders go unpunished societys future suffering is guaranteed true unity and reconciliation can only emanate from genuine justice justice is the plunder case leveled against our former president justice that she receives her day in court and can defend herself against the accusations leveled against her justice is what we witnessed on the  of may on that day we proved that justice can prevail even when confronted with an opponent in a position of power on that day a woman named delsa flores in panabo davao del norte said it is actually possible a single law governing both a simple court reporter like me and the chief justice it is possible for the scales to be set right and for even the rich and powerful to be held accountable this is why to the next chief justice much will be demanded of you by our people we have proven the impossible possible now our task is reform toward true justice that continues even after our administration there are still many flaws in the system and repairing these will not be easy i am aware of the weight of your mandate but this is what our people tasked us to do this is the duty we have sworn to do and this what we must do our objectives are simple if you are innocent you will appear in court with confidence because you will be found not guilty but if you are guilty you will be made to pay for your sins no matter who you are i would also like to thank ombudsman conchita carpiomorales for accepting the challenges that came with the position she could have turned down the responsibility citing her retirement and volunteering others for the job—but her desire to serve the nation won out this generosity was met with a grenade in her home maam more challenges will come in time perhaps theyll give you the same monikers theyve given me—a greedy capitalist who is also a communist headed toward dictatorship because of the reforms we have been working so hard to achieve i thank you for your work and i thank you for being an instrument of true justice—especially at the height of the impeachment trial i thank too the two institutions that form our congress—the senate and the house of representatives—which were weighed and measured by the filipino people and were not found wanting to everyone that ensured that our justice system worked well you weathered many challenges and criticism and even misgivings couple that with the anxiety over possible failure of having to face the ire of those you went up against after a mission lost but you did not falter the filipino people were relying on you and you proved',\n",
       "  ' that their faith was rightly placed you did not fail the nation you further brightened our futures let me remind you that our fight does not end with the ousting of one corrupt official with the suspension of an anomalous contract or the systemic overhauling of a government office i call upon congress to pass our amendments to the antimoney laundering act that we may strengthen our measures to hold the corrupt accountable every town that has and will be lighted the highways bridges airports trains and ports we have built fair contracts the peace in our cities and our rural areas every classroom desk and book assigned to a child every filipino granted a future—all of these we have achieved in just two years we have advanced an agenda of reform in these last two years a marked contrast to our suffering in the decade that came before if we share the same ideals and work for the same goals then we are bound by a shared agenda but if you are against us it only follows that you are against what we are doing whoever stands against the agenda for genuine change—can the people really count them as being on their side elections are fast approaching you our bosses will be our compass i ask you boss what direction will we take do we continue treading the straight and righteous path or do we doubleback—toward the crooked road that leads to a dead end i remember well those early days when we first started working i was keenly aware of the heavy burdens we would face and i was among those who wondered is it possible to fix a system this broken this is what i have learned in the  months i have served as your president nothing is impossible nothing is impossible because if the filipino people see that they are the only bosses of their government they will carry you they will guide you they themselves will lead you toward meaningful change it isnt impossible for the philippines to become the first country in southeast asia to provide free vaccines for the rotavirus it isnt impossible for the philippines to stand strong and say the philippines is for filipinos—and we are ready to defend it it is not impossible for the filipino who for so long had kept his head bowed upon meeting a foreigner—it is not impossible for the filipino today to stand with his head held high and bask in the admiration of the world in these times—is it not great to be a filipino last year i asked the filipino people thank those who have done their share in bringing about positive change in society the obstacles we encountered were no laughing matter and i believe it is only right that we thank those who shouldered the burdens with us in righting the wrongs brought about by bad governance to all the members of my cabinet my sincerest thanks the filipino people are lucky that there are those of you ready to sacrifice your private and much quieter lives in order to serve the public even if you know that you will receive smaller salaries dangers and constant criticism in return and i hope that they will not mind if i take this opportunity to thank them today to father catalino arevalo and sister agnes guillen who have nurtured and allowed my spiritual life to flourish especially in times of greatest difficulty my deepest gratitude this is my third sona only three remain we are entering the midpoint of our administration last year i challenged you to fully turn your back on the culture of negativism to take every chance to uplift your fellow filipinos from what we are experiencing today it is clear you succeeded you are the wellspring of change you said it is possible i stand before you today as the face of a government that knows you as its boss and draws its strength from you i am only here to narrate the changes that you yourselves have made possible this is why to all the nurses midwives or doctors who chose to serve in the barrios to each new graduate who has chosen to work for the government to each filipino athlete who proudly carries the flag

is my objective and i am aware that there are many things and many people i would have to confront in order to achieve this but i was not raised by my parents to back down in the face of challenges i

trickledown effect we cannot leave their fate—their receiving the benefits of progress—to chance what we call inclusive growth—this allencompassing progress—is the principle that drives every initiative every action and every decision of your government the only ones who will be left behind are those who chose not to venture onwards with us simply because they did not seize the opportunity the basis for this principle widespread opportunity is the key to comprehensive and sustained progress let us not forget that these opportunities are but seeds we must water them with diligence nourish them with determination and cultivate them with dedication let us take a look at our tesdadole scholars of the  people who have graduated from their programs an estimated six out of ten have found jobs before this according to studies conducted by the dbm from  to  only  percent of tesda graduates found jobs last year under tesdas itbpo program  percent of the graduates found employment under the electronics and semiconductor program the percentage of employed graduates reached  percent it is clear you are the ones who will shape this growth you are the ones who will determine whether the fruits of our labors become sweet and ripe for the picking or if you will let them rot away and waste the chances that this new chapter in our history has given us let us go through everything one by one our objective to expand the reach of the pantawid pamilyang pilipino program achieved the over  household beneficiaries we found upon coming into office in  have now grown to almost  million households in the three years of our administration there is more according to research conducted by the philippine institute for development studies compared with those who only finished the elementary level the income of high school graduates is  percent higher is it not right that we maximize the help we give these families so that our young beneficiaries can finish high school thereby helping them make the most out of the benefits of this program that is why next year families with children up to  years old will be included in this program so that their children will be able to finish high school let us move on to education our goal is to raise the quality of learning that our children undertake so that once they finish their schooling they can seize the opportunities now opening up in society accomplished we have finally erased the backlog we inherited in books and chairs and if secretary armin luistro continues to demonstrate true grit even the backlog we inherited in classrooms will also be erased this year and there is even more good news now we also have the ability to prepare for the additional needs that the implementation of the k to  program will require the problems that plagued brother armin in the deped are no laughing matter just think one textbook used to be priced at  pesos since he assumed office the price of the exact same textbook has gone down to  pesos what would have happened if we had been paying the proper price from the beginning if we had saved the difference of  pesos for all the books bought at five textbooks for each of the estimated  million students in our public school system the equivalent would amount to almost  billion pesos these savings alone could have funded our plans to repair and rehabilitate around  classrooms if brother armin didnt have strength of will he could have just left this culture of negligence in his agency for his successor to deal with he could have also left the backlog as well as the growing gap of needs because of the rising number of enrollees each year but instead of being content instead of saying this will do my job is done brother armin will build even more chairs and classrooms and will buy even more books to ensure that even the needs in future years will also be met regarding the strengthening of our agricultural sector this has also been achieved just think according to the nfa in  the country imported more than  million metric tons of rice in  this fell to  metric tons in   metric tons and now in  the maximum we including the private sector\\xa0will import will be the minimum access volume of  metric tons this includes the  metric tons of reserve buffer stock in case typhoons arrive one after the other in all likelihood even th',\n",
       "  'e private sector will no longer have to import rice because we are still on track to becoming selfsufficient in rice in addition to that we have begun exporting premiumquality rice we have truly come so far from those days when it was said that we could not even feed ourselves the proof is in the data this sector grew  percent in the first three months of  this is triple the  percent growth it recorded in the same time period in  that is why we continue to sow initiatives that will certainly bear the fruits of even greater progress for our farmers for example the coconut sector according to research conducted in  coconut farmers make up one of the poorest sectors in the country let us look at the process of growing coconuts once planted farmers wait seven years for the coconut tree to bear fruit but after this two generations will be able to benefit without doing anything else apart from harvesting the fruit we have the potential to vastly increase the income of this sector if we can foster a culture that truly encourages hard work and productivity the solution intercropping the government will help you to strengthen your coconut farms but in exchange you will be required to sow different kinds of seeds in between the rows of coconut trees \\xa0doing so will raise the frequency of crop harvests and depending on what they plant their income will also increase if they grow only coconuts the farmers would earn about  pesos a year per hectare but if they add coffee they could reach about  pesos a year if they add bananas they could earn  pesos while adding cacao would give them  pesos isnt that such a huge difference we have already begun laying down initiatives for this in  we were able to use  hectares of land for intercropping in  different locations throughout the country this program covered  farmers our target for  an additional  sites for coconut intercropping we are also now steering our fishermen towards more productive waters think about it our fishing industry contributed  billion pesos to our economy in  in spite of this based on a study last conducted in   percent of our fisherfolk still live below the poverty line they are the ones who catch the fish but all they have on their dinner tables are fish bones that is why various government initiatives are in place to help free our fisherfolk from the broad net cast by poverty an example would be our initiative for bataraza in palawan the waters here brim with fish but because the fish cannot be brought to the merchants on time still fresh the fishermen end up having to dry the fish and sell tuyo instead it is such a waste because every three kilos of lapulapu is only equivalent to one kilo of tuyo what if the freshness of the fish could be preserved in a cold storage facility you could go to the merchant and still sell your catch at full price you would exert the same amount of effort but you would receive the right compensation for it that is why the cold storage facility in bataraza is already in the works in addition we are also constructing new piers in strategic areas to raise productivity and income we are constructing and adding new roads bridges and other kinds of infrastructure including various services for our fisherfolk the dilg bfar and coast guard are also tightly monitoring irresponsible and unrestrained forms of fishing this i ask of our fishermen allow our fish to repopulate i ask for your solidarity in caring for your own livelihood as you no doubt see the state has already opened up opportunities for you but the result is in your hands if there is one topic my name is often associated with that would have to be hacienda luisita i would like to inform you that back in february in compliance with the decision of the supreme court the department of agrarian reform has completed the list of qualified beneficiaries for the land in luisita according to secretary gil de los reyes the process to determine the beneficiaries lots began last week and the turnover of these lots will begin in september of this year as for other large tracts of land we have long tasked the dar denr lra and land bank to develop a framework for speeding up the parceling out of land i would like to remind everyone correct data is the first step to the orderly implementation of carper but we inherited a land records system that is problematic and defective this is why from the start the doj lra denr and dar have worked to fix this system and now we are at a point where we can guarantee that in the next year all notices of coverage will have been served for lands covered by comprehensive agrarian reform it is clear the state was established to serve you if you have health problems the government must care for you in times of illness it should be there to give aid and support what has our government done in this regard our goal to extend philhealth coverage to more of our countrymen has been achieved when we began  percent of filipinos were enrolled now that number stands at  percent the remaining number still not on our lists are those we are seeking to identify including those in the informal settlers and indigenous peoples sectors we are counting on the cooperation of our local governments to ensure that all of our countrymen are enrolled in the system it is not just philhealths roster of enrollees that is growing so is its scope of services the past year saw the launch of the z benefit package this past february this was upgraded with the expanded z benefit package the poorest of the poor can now avail of free medical care at public hospitals for more medical conditions than ever before last year breast cancer prostate cancer and acute leukemia were included on the list of covered conditions today coronary bypass and corrective surgery for holes and defective blood vessels in the heart are also included in the package all these health benefits would go to waste if our health care facilities are substandard or inaccessible to our countrymen in the provinces this is why we have gone allout in funding health care infrastructure projects these past three years we have budgeted a total of  billion pesos for the improvement and modernization of  hospitals rural health units and barangay health stations nationwide among these are region  medical center in dagupan city which has successfully completed five kidney transplants in the last year the bicol regional training and teaching hospital in legazpi the vicente sotto medical center in cebu and the northern mindanao medical center in cagayan de oro which according to secretary ike ona of the doh now have the capacity to perform open heart surgery due to upgraded facilities and equipment there is also the davao regional hospital in tagum city the first cancer center outside metro manila regarding disaster preparedness our goal to develop mechanisms to protect the filipino people from natural calamities we have also achieved among these are the effective services brought about by the joint forces of the geohazard mapping and assessment program and of project noah of the dost this past year we completed a multihazard mapping of the  most vulnerable locations in the country a similar endeavor for the greater metro manila area will be completed by  geohazard maps for  cities and municipalities have also been completed the remaining  covering every last corner of the country will be finished before the end of  not only have these maps increased in number they are ',\n",
       "  'also more detailed and refined which is why we will be able to more accurately identify highrisk areas from the time project noah was launched a total of  automated water level monitoring stations and automated rain gauges have been installed in  major river basins throughout the country we also continue to modernize our weather detection technology with doppler radars tsunami detectors and alerting sirens but simply distributing hightech equipment and new technology is not enough we also need to train the endusers of this equipment in understanding using and disseminating the information gained when the weather is bad they no longer rely solely on wind speed for their forecasts they can also predict the volume of rainfall and they can provide correct and timely warnings so our communities can prepare accordingly we are also remedying the problem of flooding in metro manila \\xa0imagine when ondoy hit an estimated  cubic meters per second of rainfall flowed down from the sierra madre but the capacity of the channels through which these flowed can only support  cubic meters per second where would the difference of  cubic meters per second go these are the sudden torrents of water that overflow into lowlying areas and become flash floods havent we all heard before that waterways are inalienable what this means is that the channels through which water passes should be for that purpose alone the problem is in addition to the lack of adequate drainage certain structures are built obstructing these drainage systems a situation compounded by the trash of those living around it to solve this problem we are coordinating with our lgus to safely and successfully relocate our informal settlers in addition a legal team led by secretary leila de lima is preparing to file cases against those who have closed or obstructed our waterways we are not content with simply passing the blame and pointing fingers our action an allocation of  billion pesos to prevent flooding throughout metro manila this includes the construction of the blumentritt interceptor catchment area the entire project is  kilometers in length and once it is completed it will be able to catch the equivalent of  olympicsized swimming pools of water when the rains hit the rainwater now has somewhere to go and will no longer accumulate on our streets this project was started in march and we aim to complete it by next year government has been fulfilling its obligation to the people but let us ask ourselves how have i contributed to the solution if someone dumps trash into a river confront them if you see a building being built obstructing an estuary report it to the correct authorities we will only drown in our problems if we do nothing even after the storms have passed our work to restore normalcy to the lives of calamitystruck families does not end through the cooperation of the government and the private sector  houses have been erected for the victims of typhoon sendong an additional  homes will be built before the end of the following year we ask for patience and understanding the process has been delayed because of the complex process of land acquisition in truth if discussions on other tracts of land go well we will be able to construct an additional  houses we also aim to turn over a total of  homes to our countrymen who were left homeless by the onslaught of typhoon pablo we began to hand over houses in may and we will complete another  homes by the end of the year and by the time we finish the  homes still to be completed by  all the families who felt natures wrath will once again find shelter under their own roofs still on the subject of housing this time for our men and women in uniform more than a year ago we had already built  housing units for our police force and soldiers for phase ii of this project we have already built an additional  homes out of our target of  and the rest will be completed by next month apart from housing livelihood projects are being implemented for the benefit of our troops several thousand hectares of land in three of our military camps—namely fort magsaysay in nueva ecija camp kibaritan in bukidnon and camp peralta in capiz—will be the venues for these livelihood projects which will give our soldiers additional income through plantations of bamboo coffee cacao and palm oil if before soldiers were concerned solely with defending us now even military retirees can participate in improving our economy but our quest to find solutions to all the other problems we inherited regarding national defense does not stop here consider this in  there were an estimated  policemen and soldiers protecting a total of  million filipinos today we still have an estimated  policemen and soldiers who protect  million filipinos our population has almost doubled while the number of our protectors has not changed we are sure to have critics who will say is this really a problem just add more policemen and soldiers you can even reduce unemployment that way if only it were that simple let us look at the situation the common pension scheme works like this both members and employers contribute to the pension their contributions serve as capital for reinvestment and the gains of these investments will in turn fund the retiring members pensions but what is the true situation of the afp and pnp pensions no contributions have been made but there are payments to make apart from this the pensions of retirees have been indexed to the salaries of active personnel this means that if the salaries of those in the service increase so too will the pensions received by retirees or qualified families yearly there are more and more men and women retiring so naturally the obligations that must be paid out also increase what is worse is that funds from the national budget are being used for these growing obligations in   billion pesos were spent on soldiers and policemens pensions this year that figure will rise to  billion by  it will be at  billion our pension deficit will keep growing and growing and growing eating into the budget allocation for other social services how then do we add more servicemen given such a context we need a system that fulfills our civic obligations to our policemen and armed forces and it is likely that we will request the assistance of the gsis in this regard we are currently studying the feasibility of using reclaimed land to generate funds that will form part of the solution after all we cannot surprise the gsis and ask them to account for the entirety of our needs which is why an even more thorough study will be conducted to create a fair sustainable and clear mechanism for the pensions of pnp and afp personnel i call on congress today let us review pd  and ra  to ensure that these pensions are timely and balanced against national needs we see an equivalent solution for the problems that the sss pensions will soon face consider that since  acrosstheboard pension increases occurred  times but actual pension contribution increases only occurred twice as a result the sss has accumulated an estimated  trillion pesos in unfunded liability according to a study done in  this shortfall will increase by  percent per annum eventually resulting in the complete consumption of the fund  years from now if this happens the next generation is certain to suffer we believe that it is time to amend the sss pension scheme we must establish measures that remedy the outflow of funds if we add  ',\n",
       "  'percent to the contribution rate it will immediately deduct  billion pesos from the unfunded liability of the sss if we begin to invest in our future today no further problems will be handed down to the next generation of filipinos when it comes to our national police our goal to strengthen their capabilities so that they may better fulfill their mandate accomplished beginning this   policemen will finally be able go back to doing police work because we will be hiring civilian personnel who will focus on administrative work after all the skills and abilities of our police would be put to waste if we keep them imprisoned in the four corners of an office at the start of july  we began distributing new  glock  pistols to our police this is just the beginning we are slated to distribute a total of  firearms among our police force in keeping with our goal of a oneistoone policetopistol ratio these investments in our national police will yield abundant benefits especially since this redounds to more efficient and reliable public service is it not true that we have gotten used to news of violence during elections oplan katok directly addresses this the goal of the program track down loose firearms which ensures that the guns we have licensed are in the possession of those authorized to do so the police have knocked on a total of  front doors for the renewal of licenses this contributed greatly to our campaign for secure and fair elections which yielded a  percent reduction among private armed groups—from the  during the  elections to just  this  and from the  incidents of violence recorded in  we have recorded only  confirmed incidents for the recently concluded election let us use armm as an example governor mujiv hataman has said that he could not remember a time in his life when lanao del sur did not suffer a failure of elections we should note that this was the first time that the armm elections were synchronized with the national elections this means that in the past the full force of the state was focused on just one region and yet it still had to call for a failure of elections this  because our uniformed forces had to safeguard elections across the entire country there were those who thought the situation in armm would only get worse but we have seen how vastly it has improved armm successfully held a clean safe and fair election votes were counted and those whom the people charged with new mandates were proclaimed because of the diligence of our police force and of our soldiers and the coming together of the nation the  elections were more peaceful but there are still incidents that sully our police forces honor we know of what happened to the members of the ozamiz gang—ricky cadavero and wilfredo panogalinga—who were caught only to be killed as with our investigation of the atimonan incident we will ensure that those at fault will be held accountable—regardless of their rank whoever masterminded all of this prepare yourselves i am close to learning who you are despite these incidents my confidence in and hope for our police remain high they have never wanted for exemplars like  edlyn arbo who despite being offduty and unarmed bravely confronted a mugger who embarked on the jeep she was on and pursued him there are also those like  felipe moncatar who has received countless commendations because of the growing list of criminals he has put in jail i heard youve just apprehended another member of a syndicate—including members of carjacking syndicates and some of the most wanted in bacolod you may have also heard about  dondon sultan a car broke down along quezon boulevard and  sultan stopped and offered his assistance he did not just change a tire he also helped bring the car to a mechanic as thanks for his service  sultan was offered  pesos—an offer he declined he said and i quote our job is to help our countrymen we salute those of you who truly serve the public you are proof that honest and capable policemen are not an endangered species i have already instructed secretary mar roxas of the dilg and secretary voltaire gazmin of the dnd to ensure that those like you in our uniformed services reap the appropriate rewards add to these our disaster relief workers from many branches of government as well as volunteers from the private sector i know that it is not easy to battle floods dig through mud and confront calamities i will not tire of recognizing your contributions to our society i salute the way you have offered yourselves to help in lessening the suffering of our countrymen peace is also within reach in a region that has long been torn apart by conflict in october of the previous year the framework agreement on the bangsamoro was signed in truth just nine days have passed since the signing of the second annex of the agreement we are confident that we will not have to wait long before hearing more good news on the development of the peace process i am sure everyone is aware that the building of consensus is not an easy task fortunately both sides are ready to listen willing to compromise and willing to reach a meeting of the minds we know too the consequences of impatience and haste what is clear to me every word we utter must result in an action that would benefit all every line that we craft in the agreement we are forging must be set in stone and not merely written on water only to be forgotten by history my father raised me to be true to my word and i can tell our brothers and sisters of the bangsamoro whatever agreements we come to will be fulfilled by the national government trust is vital to the peace process it does not come automatically perhaps because of the long history of conflict now the desire of both sides to reach an agreement is palpable and we are truly proving ourselves trustworthy to those seeking to sow discord and doubt can you really say that you are a filipino that has compassion for his fellow filipinos i am hopeful that every filipino will contribute towards our goals for the bangsamoro we will prove that they did not make a mistake in choosing the path of peace we are ready to lend the strength of the entire nation to lift up the provinces of muslim mindanao who are among our poorest what we aim for is the triumph of all we will not allow any of our countrymen to be left behind while others surpass them once again i call on congress the transition commission that will craft the bangsamoro basic law has already been created once their task is completed in keeping with the principles of the peace process i ask you to pass the bangsamoro basic law before the end of  this way we will have ample time to prepare for the election of a new bangsamoro government come  we have accomplished whatever change we are experiencing today because we refused to be satisfied with the status quo in the government we inherited let me ask how many of you have used what they call the telepono sa barangay i wouldnt be surprised if no one has according to the dotc more than  billion pesos would have been earmarked for a program that would distribute landline phones to farflung areas would this not have been a grave waste of funds because in such a short time after its implementation the number of filipinos with cellphones just grew and grew who would take notice of the  landlines they would have installed when we have  million cellphones in the philippines here is another example of the kind of thinking weve had to eradicate from g',\n",
       "  'overnment eight combat utility helicopters were bought for what they claimed to be the more efficient deployment of our soldiers the problem the guns the helicopters were equipped with were mounted at the door requiring their removal in order to enable people to pass if you are a soldier entering the fray at the height of battle what use is a machine gun that is set aside and unable to fire did no one think about this before the contracts were signed why was this even approved in the first place we have to be more discriminating buyers we cannot rely on the sales talk of suppliers alone we have tasked the dost to assemble a body of experts who can critically assess suppliers pitches especially on bigticket items our operating principles the right identification of the root of the problem the careful study and deliberation grounded on correct methodology to arrive at the best solution this was also the rationale and the driving force behind our response to the issue of informal settlers in metro manila this is why we are already fulfilling our goal to remove from harms way those who crammed themselves into highrisk areas of the city after all i do not think anyone will disagree with us when we say the current situation cannot be allowed to persist in the general welfare clause of our constitution—article  section —it says the maintenance of peace and order the protection of life liberty and property and promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy here we have proven that the filipino listens to reason if it is clear that compassion is your bedrock principle then we will be more eager to work with you before roofs were dismantled before walls were demolished we explained how we came to our decision better housing access to public transport and for the diligent no shortage of opportunities to earn we made it clear that we wanted to provide a refuge to those who were highrisk and most in need—and not to syndicates we are aware that whenever the aid given by the state is abused the lives of other filipinos are also put in jeopardy after a batch of informal settlers was moved to the relocation site they urged their former neighbors join us it is safer here this year our priority is to relocate more than  families living along metro manilas major waterways the convergence of dilg nha dswd mmda and dpwh has resulted in a much clearer solution to one of our most longstanding problems another example of transformation in government havent vital bills languished in congress in the previous year the sin tax reform law and the responsible parenthood law were finally signed into laws we thank our partners in congress and in the senate who helped us push for the passage of these laws we persevered through the long process of debate and consultation we were not cowed by those who tried to sow doubt in the attempt to obstruct our meaningful agenda we have fought for what benefits the people and we are advancing true public service for the filipino i would also like to propose to congress several laws that will help us sustain and improve on the reforms we have established let us amend the cabotage law in order to foster greater competition and to lower the cost of transportation for our agricultural sector and other industries let us likewise enact the fiscal incentives rationalization bill so that the incentives we provide to businesses become even clearer and more accountable we also have to focus on the land administration reform bill given the need for convergence among agencies tasked to oversee our land holdings and thus ensuring that they can fulfill their collective mandate with increased efficiency tomorrow we are submitting to congress our proposed  trillionpeso national budget for  i am confident of your support and advocacy for the allocation of funds which was arrived at after careful consideration this budget is not only a continuation of our reforms but it will also accelerate our momentum towards longlasting inclusive progress there are those who insist on upgrading our armed forces i agree with this but some of them act as if they want us to invest every centavo of our country into fighter jets tanks and other equipment for warfare they may not know that one fighter jet costs  billion pesos—equivalent to  houses for our soldiers and our police force or nearly  classrooms for our children and what can one jet do to be truly effective we would need a squadron—and one squadron is composed of twentyfour fighter jets at  billion pesos per jet we would have to devote  billion pesos of the nations coffers just to assemble one squadron and what about practice missiles and it is not as if jet fuel a radar system ground bases and ground intercept controls are free building a minimum credible defense posture is not something we can take lightly do we follow others who prioritize the possession of a nuclear option at the expense of everything else i do not think anyone would agree we will balance our needs we are committed to meeting the needs of our society while remaining a good and upstanding member of the community of nations we are well aware that in the past decisions were made based on politics leaders did everything they could just to keep a firm hold on their power—at the expense of the suffering of present and future generations of filipinos let us look for example at the consequences of refusing to raise passenger fares for the lrt and mrt each trip that one passenger makes on the lrt is estimated to cost  pesos what does each passenger pay  pesos this means that the government subsidizes the remaining  pesos as for the mrt the true cost of one trip is  pesos  pesos paid by passengers  pesos by the government—in the end each and every filipino pays a share of the subsidy whether you live in mindanao or visayas and not once have you ever stepped onto the lrt or mrt you help to fund this whats worse because past leaders gave away our commercial development rights each peso that we can earn from the posters and billboards in the stations goes to private companies instead of going to the government what we could have used to subsidize the cost of maintenance and operations was given away perhaps it is only reasonable for us to move the fares of the mrt and lrt closer to the fares of airconditioned buses so that the government subsidy for the mrt and lrt can be used for other social services you are my witnesses we have no plans to hand down problems to our successors in truth projects that were left to decay in the past are now truly benefiting the people let us look at the ternatenasugbu road this road connecting cavite batangas and metro manila is only six kilometers long but it still took almost  years to finish we already opened one part of this road and when the sections requiring slope protection are completed the benefit this road will bring to motorists will be complete we also have the aluling bridge in ilocos sur the plans for its construction were first laid down on paper in  and we made certain that our successors would not merely inherit sheets of paper the bridge was finally completed in march last month we also began the operation of the laguindingan airport—a project that took one generation to make the leap from idea to implementation there is also the semiconductor industry which waited decades for a laboratory that could compete with facilities of other coun',\n",
       "  'tries we did not allow them to wait much longer in may of this year under the leadership of dost we inaugurated the advanced device and materials testing laboratory admatel before products manufactured here had to be sent to other countries to undergo testing we were unable to maximize profits in this industry we were unable to maximize the potential of our semiconductor industry to attract even more investments because of admatel products will now be manufactured and tested here and we will be able to take even greater advantage of the skills of filipino workers in the electronics sector and we have every expectation that this industry—one that contributed almost  percent to our exports in —will grow even stronger with the help of our big man in the senate senator franklin drilon the more than fiftyyear wait of ilonggos has come to an end the implementation of the jalaur river multipurpose project ii in iloilo has started how will this help us first an estimated  farmers across iloilo will benefit from yearround irrigation as a result the harvests of rice farmers may double let me make it clear the  hectares of land that will be irrigated will yield an additional  metric tons of rice this amount is equal to almost  percent of the buffer stock of rice that we will import for  this does not include the other benefits that this project will bring for instance preventing widespread flooding in iloilo and adding  megawatts in hydropower to the energy requirements of the province this project will also contribute to the supply of water for some parts of the province and to the development of its ecotourism industry apart from all these the jalaur river project will create around  jobs and once it becomes fully operational an estimated  filipinos will be given decent livelihoods this project was first conceived in —the same year i was born we are aware that many of our countrymen are excited to see the fruits of our publicprivate partnership ppp projects we likewise know that there are those who have grown impatient waiting for them let us put things into context back in  when our administration came into office we were left with only  percent of the programmable budget for the year or just around  billion pesos  percent of the budget had already been allotted by my predecessor this is precisely why we approached the private sector we told them we do not have the funds let us partner with one another to build the necessary infrastructure apart from this we faced other difficulties when ppp began the studies on which the projects were based were outdated and the bureaucracy lacked the sufficient knowledge to implement them not to mention the public who seemed to have lost confidence in the contracts the government undertook nevertheless whatever the situation may be our principle is that anything worth doing is worth doing right we have no plans of entering into questionable contracts today just to bequeath problems to the next administration each project has to go through the correct process to ensure that our taxpayers hardearned money will be spent the right way as early as now we are seeing the effects of the honest transparent and clear way we have been going about our ppp projects previously even just the construction of a single airport already made headlines let us compare this to what we are seeing today apart from the laguindingan airport which is already being utilized we are upgrading and modernizing the tacloban airport the bicol international airport the new bohol airport the mactan airport and the puerto princesa airport all at the same time the daang harinlex link road is the fastest ppp project that has been awarded in any administration with no shortcuts in the processes all these and all the other infrastructure projects that are being and will be constructed will give rise to a society teeming with opportunity the problems that we have inherited—and are currently solving—make up a long list for example the recurring rotating blackouts in mindanao from the very beginning we have been working on a solution for this—but we are also aware that a problem that has been ignored for an entire decade cannot be solved overnight right now we continue to take steps to address the shortages as well as provide for immediate needs we have helped electric cooperatives bring in generator sets that will reduce brownouts and this will continue until the plants that will supply the region with more electricity are completed but the critics will never fully disappear some are complaining that the price of electricity will increase with the usage of dieselfueled generator sets hydropower is abundant now because of the rainy season so we hear objections to the generator sets but come summer many will once again complain about eighthour brownouts we also want more power plants built in other parts of the philippines as our economy grows so will our consumption of electricity which means we must likewise increase supply do we really want to wait until our plants are at full capacity before more plants are built power plants do not sprout like mushrooms—a power plant takes two to three years to construct if anyone has a good suggestion we are ready to listen but i also hope that the kibitzers put the situation in the proper context the plant in redondo zambales is a good example a tro was issued against the plant because of the argument that renewable energy is better did they happen to mention that renewable energy is also more expensive—from the cost of building the plants to the eventual price of energy did they mention that it cannot provide the baseload—the capacity required to make sure brownouts do not occur if you put up a windpowered plant what do you do when there is no wind if you put up a solar plant what do you when the sky is cloudy let me be clear i believe in renewable energy and we support its use but there should also be baseload plants that can ensure a steady supply of electricity for our homes and industries i wonder if those who are critical of the plants we want put up will be as noisy when they are busy fanning themselves during brownouts all i am really saying is this let us help each other find a solution since we are being frank with each other let us talk about the renovation of naia  this is a complex issue which has already undergone two arbitrations we would have won both of them but one of the decisions was reversed due to a technicality this is why we are now preparing for our case to be heard once more and there are added complications because of the issue of warranties for the completion of naia —it is not acceptable for us to find defects after renovations and then have to spend even more money to fix them this is why when we were told that the original contractor was willing to give a proper warranty we agreed to the deal but we want to be certain we want to fully and correctly go through the process so i must ask for your understanding on this issue today it is clear a single goal is behind each square meter of cement we pour in building the foundations of a more progressive country gain for all—and not politics whereas before roads were constructed based on whims and bridges were built where the mayor enjoyed the friendship of madam now we follow a nationwide plan no favorites no transactionalism no patronage each peso is spent to accelerate our goal of broadbased growth what we can expect in the years to come air',\n",
       "  'ports and ports to facilitate commerce and tourism roads to ensure that we all reap the maximum benefit from these bigticket projects power plants that will generate enough energy and fuel the development of industry this is the framework from which other initiatives will branch out creating even greater opportunities for juan and juana dela cruz—from the farmer who will have access to adequate irrigation and who will be able to sell his harvest more quickly to the construction workers erecting new buildings from the continued development of call centers across the country to the rise of even more businessmen ready to invest in the philippines we implemented the right projects for the right price we completed these projects with the right quality and we finished or we will finish these projects right on time because the right people worked on them let us talk about traffic isnt it estimated that our economy loses an estimated  billion pesos every day because of metro manila traffic among the projects targeted to decongest manila is the integrated transport system for the buses that force themselves onto alreadycrowded roads we will construct terminals in areas with less traffic our countrymen can already make use of the terminal in parañaque and the ones in quezon city and muntinlupa are already lined up provincial buses will be permitted only up to these terminals so they do not add to the congestion there is also the two connector roads that will join the north and south luzon expressways to tell you the truth there were already plans to construct what they called the metro manila highway in the seventies this would have connected the two expressways so that traveling from one point to another need not consume the hours it takes to pass through the entire length of edsa the problem mr marcos issued laws that favored one of his cronies and unfortunately we are required to follow them whoever constructs infrastructure in those areas must be in partnership with the corporation of mr marcos friend even worse every time they add even just another short section to the original road their franchise is extended by thirty years that is not the end of it once the company profited the development of infrastructure in the area was left unfinished remember that these roads were supposed to traverse pangasinan to quezon but when the company operated at a loss they had the audacity to pass on to the government a multitude of debts i ask our congress today let us take another look at presidential decrees  and  despite this our projects continue we have an eightkilometer fourlane elevated expressway that will connect  road to caloocan crossing españa up to pup in sta mesa there is also a more than fourteenkilometer sixlane elevated tollway extending from balintawak to buendia in makati the common alignment of these two roads a fiveandahalf kilometer sixlane elevated expressway from pup in sta mesa crossing osmeña and quirino avenue to buendia in makati once this road is opened to the public what once took two hours from slex to nlex will now take only fifteen minutes what once was a threehour drive from clark to calamba will be reduced by almost half to an hour and forty minutes every day an estimated  motorists will benefit from this project motorists will save time and gas pollution will be decreased and commerce and tourism will flourish is this not a winwin situation in the space of only three years we have proven that agencies that were once cesspools of corruption can be transformed into examples of honest and efficient service some of the simple but effective reforms that secretary singson implemented in dpwh no more letters of intent which bidders once used in conspiring with each other to inflate costs and gain more profit simplified bidding processes so even more contractors can compete for projects and reasonable costs of doing projects government also now pays on time attracting even more skilled contractors to do their part in raising the quality of public infrastructure this kind of honest leadership has allowed the dpwh to save  billion pesos which has been allotted to other meaningful projects as an example of the dividends of good governance let us look at the tagumbao bridge in gerona tarlac in truth i was an advocate of its construction back when i was just a congressman back then some of my constituents had to circle around two towns just to cross a river that overflowed during the rainy season i even told past administrations you can have my entire pdaf just complete the bridge in installments if possible but nothing happened and time passed the gap separating the banks of the river—and thus the length of the bridge that was required—only widened further right now we are constructing the tagumbao bridge now that we are the ones implementing it this is the story approved funds for the project stand at around  million pesos but because of good management and prudent spending the cost was lowered to  million pesos in the end we saved a total of over  million pesos without sacrificing the quality of the completed bridge and even better the funds that we saved can be used in the construction of a dike and river training projects for phase ii let us move on to tourism according to the oriental morning post we are the best tourism destination of  and it seems the shanghai morning post fell in love with our country when they named us the most romantic destination of  scuba diving magazine says that the philippines is the best diving destination and palawan is the best island if you ask travel  leisure magazine it seems they just stopped short of calling us paradise given such resounding praise it comes as no surprise that in  we registered  million tourist arrivals in our country—another new record high this figure is a  percent increase from when we assumed office in  when only an estimated  million tourists visited our country when it comes to our domestic travelers our previous target for  was  million tourists but we have surpassed this as early as  with  million domestic tourists with the momentum that we are now experiencing we have full confidence that we will achieve our new domestic target of  million before the end of  a stronger tourism sector will generate more job opportunities the dot estimates that tourism created  million jobs in  the truth is it is not just our scenic and most famed destinations that will profit from the arrival of tourists but also the nearby towns that can be considered tourism support communities the places from which resorts and hotels source the food that they serve the souvenirs that they sell as well as other products and services that provide a source of income for our provinces and i am certain that you have also heard the good news that has recently landed in our country last march the international civil aviation organization removed the significant safety concerns they had previously imposed on the philippines this was a fruit of our reforms in the aviation industry to ensure that aviation safety in the philippines meets international standards and because of this just last july  the european union has once again permitted our flag carrier to resume direct flights to europe think about it what if our aviation industry had already been improved and strengthened before was it not a waste to miss out on tourists whose lack of enthusiasm for visiting the country can be attributed to this missed jobs ',\n",
       "  'funds and opportunities—these are the results of the previous system of governance this is why from the very onset we have fought against corruption in all levels of government and pushed for the transformation of our institutions the result public service that truly benefits our countrymen let us just look at the depth of transformation taking place in our goccs governmentowned corporations whose losses were previously subsidized by the national government are now turning over dividends let us take the philippine reclamation authority pra as an example in the thirteen years prior to our term from  to  the dividends of the pra amounted to a sum total of  million pesos along the straight path in  alone their dividends— billion pesos is this not a complete transformation the local water utilities administration is another good example in  the said gocc recorded a net loss of  million pesos but because of prudent management they did more than just balance their books based on their report their gross income amounted to  million pesos in  because of this they were able to remit  million pesos to government for that same year yet another example in my first sona we exposed the questionable practices of the mwss whose officials were giving themselves excessive bonuses and allowances even as their company failed to address the needs of our citizens this agency itself reported the mwss registered losses amounting to  million pesos in  this was completely unacceptable that is why in  we signed the gocc governance act which serves as the standard for integrity credibility and accountability in the management of our goccs its results in  the mwss earned  million pesos from the  loss of  in  their earnings totaled almost  billion pesos consequently their dividends have also increased from  million in  these increased to  million pesos for  it is saddening though that the depth of the reforms planted by the mwss leadership is tarnished by the mudslinging of those who want to cling to the old system in tandem with the increased confidence in our good governance is the continued resurgence of our economy the results two consecutive tenplace jumps in the global competitiveness index of the world economic forum for the first time in history we attained investmentgrade status from two of the three most respected credit ratings agencies in the world and it is quite possible that the third will soon follow suit we have maintained the stability of our consumer goods prices and we continue to reduce the portion of our budget allotted to paying our debts while increasing the funds allotted to social services in a period of lethargic global economic activity we registered an astounding  percent gdp growth in  we surpassed this in the first quarter of  when we reported growth of  percent—the highest recorded gdp in east and southeast asia special mention must be made of the  percent contributed by the manufacturing sector to the growth of our economy and we anticipate that manufacturing will gain even more traction in the coming years we are now considered a rising tiger by the world bank the brightest spark according to the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales among other accolades that allude to the transformation that is sweeping our nation from the prudent expenditure of funds to the effective collection of taxes from infrastructure development to the transparent conduct of business that generates jobs our message to the world could not be clearer the philippines is ready to ride the tides of progress the transformation of our society is not just evident in the economy or in statistics now filipinos know rich or poor with or without political connections when you do wrong you will pay the consequences now justice is truly blind we will not undermine the orders of our bosses to hold the corrupt accountable and to right the wrongs of a system that has long beggared our country in fact we are already holding the former leadership of tesda accountable for his part in the outrageous overpricing of purchases by the agency for example one incubator jar is priced at  pesos but mr syjuco priced the same jar at  pesos the normal price of a dough cutter  pesos the price according to mr syjuco  pesos lets be clear this is a dough cutter not a hamilton class cutter perhaps when he finally has his day in court to face the cases filed by the ombudsman mr syjuco will finally learn to count we have also indicted the former pagcor officials who embezzled  million pesos just to produce a movie burned through funds amounting to  million pesos to finance a partylist and had the gall to use the rice donations allotted to calamity victims for campaign sorties former leaders of the pnp are also being made to answer allegations regarding the  million pesos wasted on seventyfive defective rubber boats and the  million pesos spent on the anomalous purchase of secondhand helicopters from  to  \\xa0it would actually be better if they are able to properly answer questions regarding this so we may discover if there are others who must also be held accountable on the topics of cadavero pdaf mrt  and others just because the critics are not aware of what we are doing they assume that we are doing nothing about these issues if government possesses no data and yet announces who it will investigate does that not send a message to the suspects to just hide the evidence this is why we go where the truth takes us the evidence decides our path when we denounced the wangwang culture we did not just dismantle the sirens of those who lord it over the streets we also uprooted the culture of corruption that seemed firmly entrenched in our public institutions but let us be honest even today there are still those in government who seemingly refuse to change it is disheartening to discover the depth and breadth to which they have branched out in the bureaucracy the moment we look away someone is sure to be taken advantage of and victimized the time has come to name names we have repeatedly admonished the bureau of immigration to improve their watch over our ports and airports how then was it possible for the brothers joel and mario reyes the principal suspects in the slaying of gerry ortega to leave the country \\xa0how could the escape of the korean park sungjun—as blatantly seen in cctv footage—have taken place he is wanted in south korea and their government asked for our assistance in securing his arrest how can we face them now when our own government employees are the ones who enabled his escape the makedo culture at the nia has also tested our patience instead of laying out plans for new irrigation systems they are merely content with the continued rehabilitation of existing irrigation for them shoddy repairs are enough to say they have already done a good job during their anniversary i asked them why only  percent of their target was accomplished in  when they had reached  percent in  the next day i met with their head during the neda board meeting his excuse  percent of the target areas were located in mindanao and were devastated by typhoon pablo thus the delay when were we hit by typhoon pablo in the first week of december which means that he meant to complete the remaining  percent of his tasks in the span of just

malacañang ordered this you will only be there for six years it is time to rectify this way of thinking i call on our congress to examine our civil service code and  so that we can revise these at the earliest possible time i support the development of mechanisms that will restore the integrity of public service that will ensure that only honest capable and principled civil servants will be allowed to enter and remain in government service and now lets allow our countrymen to share the transformations taking place in their lives  my name is violeta s abuque we didnt have  before life was hard you didnt have any money and you couldnt approach anyone to ask for help because they didnt have anything either we were very happy that when dswd launched their program it covered even those of us living in the mountains this program will help me put my children to school weve realized how important it is to invest in your childrens education theyll have a different life from our ancestors who couldnt even write their own names i am very thankful for the  program and to everyone who has supported this — violeta s abuque cct beneficiary before my children couldnt even bring food to eat in school—but now they can and they even have breakfast you really have to fulfill the conditions that come with the program and of course you have to find a way to complement and augment the help theyve given you so every week my child and i make some peanut butter and sell it i am very grateful that im part of the  program because it has been a really big help to my family — dulce panaligan cct beneficiary i went back to selling balut  while i was looking for a job and then i heard that tesda was holding trainings i read up on these and i registered im very happy with how the tesda program has helped me with my jobseeking ive used what ive learned so i can get a better life so i can learn more things—especially applying what ive learned to my job — emerson paguia tesda scholar it web

he stabbed me on the thigh but i got the knife from him before he got off the jeep i stuck the knife in his back i chased after him and we were both bleeding this was probably what got the peoples attention which eventually led to the muggers arrest im always aware of the oath i took to serve our citizens to my fellow police officers let us always do what is right and what is for the good of the country—at the same time what will reflect well on what were doing as pnp —  edlyn arbo philippine national police i was assigned to police station  from  to  i was given a spot meritorious promotion by the president probably because of my apprehension of some of bacolod citys most wanted criminals last saturday i used the new gun the president had given me recently to apprehend notorious car burglars here in bacolod city we do our jobs even if its difficult even if we have to put our lives on the line—we do it so we can serve our fellowmen and our country —  felipe moncatar philippine national police my car broke down along quezon avenue just after the tunnel a policeman arrived after fifteen minutes and he really helped me out—he even tried to lift the car with his bare hands so i was thinking that eventually he would ask for a reward then the towing vehicle arrived and they were about to tow my car but this policeman said no help first before you haul out of gratitude i tried to hand him  pesos for his help but he refused it he told me our job is to help the citizens there has been positive change among our police force to po sultan i salute you — armin

government has been giving us so much and we just need to do our jobs well in return—to give back to the country to give back to the people — lt commander desuasido philippine navy  our country has never lacked for people prepared to take a stand and fight for our country regardless of the enormity of the challenges before them there is the courage of commodore ramon alcaraz during the second world war in a small wooden qboat he took on nine japanese zero fighters—then considered among the most modern planes three of these he shot down in fact he would have continued fighting had he not received an order from his superiors to surrender this type of bravery is what our soldiers display every day as they patrol our most remote mountains and our farthest islands soldiers who continuously bear the distance from their families who proudly stand their ground against anyone who challenges our sovereignty it is no exaggeration either when i say that the triumphs we have achieved along the straight path might still be distant aspirations had it not been for the members of our cabinet when i asked them to join the government they knew their jobs were not going to be easy that they accepted the challenges was a blessing they took an oath to help in transforming the country and from the beginning they have made sacrifices every day so that the privilege of serving you does not go to waste there are those like secretary albert del rosario going by tradition a secretarys first official travel outside the philippines would be to a country with whom we enjoy strong

libya you might also be surprised to hear the nationalities of the men and women we also ended up evacuating truly the philippines is different today from a country that was always just the recipient of help we have become a country capable of providing help all things considered secretary albert could have said no to working in government he is a successful and respected businessman and certainly he would be much more comfortable living a private life he had also already served as ambassador to america he could have become disillusioned after being removed from his position because he opposed the past administrations declaration of a state of emergency back in  but we asked him to return to government and he did now he is contributing even more as secretary he is ready to put himself in harms way because he knows that no one else will save filipinos but fellow filipinos for continuing to stand up for our rights i salute you secretary albert del rosario we also know that excellent public servants do not just transform a society they inspire millions of filipinos grieved when jesse robredo passed for almost two decades he served and led naga with skill compassion and humility these principles of his are the exact reasons we borrowed him from congresswoman leni and their three children and from the nagueños so that he could become part of our cabinet this is why one of the hardest things i ever had to do as president was to deliver the news to leni and their daughters after the tragedy apart from grieving i could not avoid blaming myself for what happened to jesse maybe if i had not asked him to join my cabinet he would still be alive today maybe if he had remained in naga he would still be with us maybe there would still be a jesse robredo in public service today but i also know that jesse would not allow the transformation and righting of society to end with him jesse and i were only given opportunities to serve the country because of all of you we cannot have just one face for transformation and change we should not have to wait another hundred years before the next good citizen is born before the next good filipino rises to the occasion there are those who always ask what will happen in  what will happen when you step down will that be the end of good honest governance will we have reached the end of the straight and righteous path my bosses let us remember where did we begin if you have doubts now compare them with the doubts we all carried in  were we not happy enough then just to see the darkness end was it not enough for us to be able to replace those in power now we are experiencing change change that has sprung from the seeds of kindness solidarity and good will change that was brought about by the millions of filipinos who have in their own ways big and small pitched in and transformed the country and just look at where working together as one people has brought us did anyone imagine that peace would be within reach for a region that has for the past  years been torn apart by conflict who else could be responsible for this but the moros who laid down their arms and said come lets talk i trust you who else but the common filipino citizen who said brother we are all filipinos let us put an end to this conflict when the pantawid pamilya program was initially proposed there were some who asked how could we possibly achieve the programs desired effects where are the funds to cover all poor filipinos did anyone imagine that in just three years we will have expanded the scope of our project to cover  million household beneficiaries and isnt it they themselves who continue to help this program succeed each mother who wakes up early to send her child off to school each child that studies hard did anyone imagine that from importing millions of tons of rice we would be  percent rice selfsufficient by the end of  did anyone imagine that a country known as the sick man of asia would within three years of good governance reach investmentgrade status who would have thought that all the social interventions the government is providing right now would be doable without raising taxes apart from the sin tax and did they not have a part in this—each accountant each doctor each lawyer who now pays the right taxes didnt we all have a part in this is there any space left for doubt especially now that we are achieving things we never thought we could achieve especially now that we have made progress—that our shared goals are within reach my bosses is this really the time for doubt for every filipino who believes in the strength of small acts of kindness you made this transformation possible this is your sona for every teacher who wakes at dawn just to teach children in farflung areas

members of the military police and other uniformed services my fellow public servants and to my bosses the filipino people good afternoon this is my fifth sona only one remains we have a saying those who do not look back to the past will never get to where they wish to go therefore today it is only right for us to reflect on what we have gone through this was our situation in the past to dream was an absurdity we had a senseless bureaucracy padded contracts had become the norm and corruption was endemic to the system we were known as the sick man of asia the economy was weak industry was sparse we failed to gain the confidence of investors the result very few jobs were created we found a people deprived of hope many of us had already given up and were forced to take their chances in other countries with heads bowed we had come to accept that we would never be able to rely on our government or our society the philippines sank deep into despair because of dirty politicsour trust in each other disappeared the confidence of the world in the philippines ebbed and worst of all we lost faith in ourselves it was at this juncture that we began our journey on the straight and righteous path as the father of our nation on my shoulders rest not only the problems that we inherited and the problems that arise today—it is also my duty to prepare for the future at every moment i must be mindful of the concerns and perspectives of all think about it this way it is as if you are watching two hundred tv channels at the same time you need to understand not just what is unfolding before you—you also need to know what happened before and where it could all lead confusion is not an option and you must have a response for every question suggestion and criticism—and you must have all the answers even before the questions are asked this is not an easy job and i am only human one who at times is also capable of feeling apprehension in spite of this my resolve is firm because my primary goal is clear to return government to its rightful mandate—to serve the filipino people always\\xa0 is it not true that we have a saying give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime an example of this is the technical education and skills development authority tesda the disbursement acceleration program contributed  billion pesos to tesdas training for work scholarship program this amount enabled the graduation of  beneficiaries  percent of these—or  graduates—now have jobs as for the remaining  percent tesda is helping them find employment just take a look all of these scholars have their names and other pertinent data listed down should you wish to confirm them  if we divide the allocated funding by the number of graduates we will see that government invested around  pesos in every scholar in the bpo sector a monthly salary of  is already considered at the low end every year he will earn  pesos if he is given the maximum tax deduction his annual income tax will be  pesos this means that in the first year alone the  pesos that the government invested in him would have been paid back—and there will even be a profit this and all the taxes he will be paying the government until he retires will in turn provide his countrymen with the same opportunities he was given this is good governance  the right intentions practices and results everyone wins let us listen to the stories of two tesda graduates translated transcript of testimonial of marc joseph escora tesda beneficiary even when youve realized your dreams you should know that success its still not stable you still need to work hard for it i am marc joseph escora i am a high school graduate through the help of the technical education and skills development authority  i have my career in the business process outsourcing bpo industry right now i was based in the libertad public market for seven years i worked as a barker forpublic transportation vehicles my family couldnt afford to put all of us through school so i needed to find a way to support myself so i could graduate the most important thing ive learned is to have the confidence to interact with other people when people see that you have a disability they usually wont be able to see past it to your abilities so you need to trust yourself if tesda wasnt there to help me i probably wouldnt be where i am now our way of living now is much better than how we lived back then  translated transcript of testimonial of jonnalyn navarossa tesda beneficiary tesda helped

region  i chose to study automotive servicing because ive always dreamed of being a mechanical engineer in order for me to both earn a living and save up i enrolled at tesda were used to thinking that being an auto mechanic is a mans job but ive proven that as long you work hard as long as youre determined we can ensure quality products tesda taught me the value of good clean and quality work now

resources we are striving to ensure that all those who crossed the poverty line will never go back below it  when we came into office we found a society that was like a derelict house in which we had no choice but to live what was even worse we had virtually no tools and materials with which to repair the damage over the past few years with the help of every filipino who cared for the wellbeing of his fellowmen we have been acquiring the tools and materials we need one of these tools is a budget focused solely on the needs of the citizenry—a budget we have passed ontime four years in a row these tools include the laws that have accelerated the bringing of benefits to our bosses this is where—under a fair system—the resurgence of our economy began we were able to save because of prudent fiscal management we were able to expand the coverage of essential services without raising taxes apart from sin tax reform whose goal is to reduce vice in society  we worked to have the ability to fund the projects that we implemented are implementing and will be implementing we strengthened tax collections from  trillion pesos in collections in  we increased this to  trillion pesos in   we improved the management of our debt the result a decrease in our debt to gdp ratio money that once went to paying interest we were able to channel into social services we were even able to fulfill the obligations of government that we inherited from past administrations for example in  or during the administration of president ramos the government was required to recapitalize the central bank of the philippines with  billion pesos so that it could fulfill its mandate president ramos was able to fund  billion pesos \\xa0and nothing was added since then  billion pesos was the obligation left to us and we have paid this in full  we worked hard to accumulate the funds government has today which is why we will not tolerate wasting it if our bosses choose the right leaders succeeding administrations will be able to surpass what we have done because our administration has greatly reduced the number of problems remaining giving them a stronger foundation from which to begin why do we say a stronger foundation just this past  for the first time in history the philippines was upgraded to investment grade status by moodys fitch and standard and poors—the three major credit ratings agencies in the world through their study of our macroeconomic fundamentals and governance they determined that there was less risk which led to a vast increase in confidence on the part of investors just this may they upgraded the philippines yet again what this means because the philippines is now investment grade government will be able to borrow funds for programs and projects at lower interest rates more businesses will be attracted to invest in our country and filipinos will be able to feel the benefits of our economic resurgence more quickly  if anyone were to add up all the investmentsthat came in through the philippine economic zone authority peza since its inception in  they would see that  percent of total investments in peza came in during the four years of our administration the remaining  percent took  years for past administrations to accumulatewe are confident that before we step down from office we will be able to match or even surpass this amount to director general lilia de lima thank you for all you have done and for all that you will do to achieve this success  our economy and our country are indeed taking off and we are already realizing even greater aspirations for instance we inherited a seemingly grounded aviation industry significant safety concerns had been issued on the philippines by the international civil aviation organization or icao we were downgraded by the united states federal aviation administration and the european union implemented restrictions against our local carriers in  icao lifted the significant safety concerns it had previously issued for the philippines this was followed in the same year by the european union lifting the ban on philippine airlines allowing it to fly once again to europe—which means that filipinos will be able to fly directly from manila to london  naturally cebu pacific will soon follow suit since they have also received the go signal from the eu in  in this year as well the united states federal aviation administration upgraded the philippines back to category  because of this upgrade it is likely that there will also be an increase in routes going to the united states the increase in flights of our local airlines to the united states and participating countries in the eu is a big help to both tourism and business today we continue to receive news that because of all the tourists and businessmen who wish to visit the philippines there is actually a shortage of flights to our country so all of the upgrades we have received in aviation are indeed good news the number of flights will rise thus providing a solution to the problem and through the continued cooperation of the caap and our local carriers we will certainly be able to attract more businessmen and tourists in the coming years this is a win for all those in the tourism sector this is a win for the filipino people good governance is the source of these upgrades and we thank director general william hotchkiss the caap and our local carriers for their hard work  indeed the philippines is in the limelight on the global stage just this may when we successfully hosted the world economic forum on east asia we showed the world just what we were capable of and with the apec summit the philippines will be hosting next year we will be able to inform even more people of our progress and the opportunities that this has opened up for all there is no doubt the philippines is indeed more open for business  apart from fostering an improved busines climate we are also pursuing better relations between labor and managment consider this according to the national conciliation and mediation board since  the number of strikes per year has been limited to less than t',\n",
       "  'en this is the positive result of the department of labor and employments single entry approach or sena through which filed labor cases go through a  conciliationmediation period the good news out of  notices of strike and lockout in  only one pushed through this is the lowest number of strikes in the history of dole for these achievements i extend my gratitude to secretary rosalinda baldoz the dole family and the labor and management sectors secretary baldoz and i were joking in around  that there were two strikes and in  there was just one i said linda in  a halfstrike wont do maybe we can strive for no strikes  we are well aware that we need infrastructure in order to sustain the momentum of our economy and to continue creating opportunities in the country infrastructure will entice businessmen—it will speed up the transport of goods and services and will help us ensure that we can go head to head with overseas markets this sector has seen massive changes our budget for infrastructure has more than doubled from the  billion pesos of  to  billion pesos this   i remind everyone we did this without adding any new taxes apart from the sin tax reform which is focused on health while we maintained our allowable deficit and with our debttogdp ratio continually declining this has had a profound effect because we have not only increased the infrastructure budget we have also plugged leaks in the system which has ensured that the citizenry is getting more value for its money under the leadership of secretary babes singson of the department of public works and highways dpwh neither kickbacks nor overpricing is condoned the loopholes in the old system were plugged the agencys processes were streamlined a simple example would be the removal of letters of intent from the bidding process in the past these bred a culture of collusion—knowing who was bidding on the same project only created a space for collusion another example the requisite documents from bidders were trimmed to five from  processes are faster and there are now fewer opportunities for the unscrupulous to ask for bribes this allowed the department to save \\xa0 billion pesos and allowed them to accelerate the implementation of the next projects  to secretary babes and the dpwh again thank you very much  it is truly aweinspiring in addition to what the dpwh has saved the roads that they have laid out fixed widened or constructed have amounted to a total of  kilometers  when i saw these figures i thought how can i visualize  kilometers think of it this way this is equivalent to four roads that connect laoag to zamboanga city and this just only accounts for the national roads that number doesnt include local farmtomarket roads or tourism roads  now regarding the publicprivate partnership program from december  to just this june your government has awarded and signed off on seven ppp projects with a total value of  billion pesos in just our four years on the straight path we have surpassed the combined six approved solicited ppp projects of the past three administrations  the difference between then and now is massive as secretary cesar purisima said in the past the philippines could not entice investors then the government had to roll out incentives like commercial development rights subsidies and other guarantees for profit just to attract bidders now the situation has reversed companies are now in close competition trying to outdo each other they are ready and willing to pay for the privilege to build the infrastructure we need for example with the mactancebu international airport passenger terminal building the government has a premium that amounts to more than  billion pesos with the naia expressway project phase  the government received a premium of  billion pesos again good economics is borne of good governance  let us take a look at the tplex because of this road the journey from tarlac to rosales in pangasinan has become easier according to the proponents of the project the segment of the road that reaches urdaneta will be completed before the year ends and by next year the tplex will have extended to the end of rosario la union  infrastructure projects that long ago had been promised by other administrations we have been able to turn into concrete reality the aluling bridge which was conceived in  is finally open to the public metro manila skyway stage  part of the metro manila expressway project from the  was launched this january those who traverse osmeña highway can attest to how speedily its columns are being constructed the ternatenasugbu road the plans for which started to be laid out in  is now  complete  the basilan circumferential road which has been under construction since  will soon be completed these are but a few of the infrastructure projects that we do not intend to pass on as problems to succeeding administrations instead our bosses have already begun to make use of them again because of good governance we now have a greater capacity to find solutions to problems that are on the horizon for example water we all know that as our population grows and as our economy continues on its upward trajectory the country will need a greater water supply in the coming years according to some studies there may be a shortage of water in metro manila by  we will not wait for a drought the solutions that experts have studied assiduously we have already approved—the kaliwa dam project in quezon and the repair of the lines of angat dam these solutions are significantly better than sourcing water from underground aquifers which are more easily penetrated by saltwater on top of this if we were to rely solely on aquifers then we would only hasten the sinking of land—which would contribute to flooding together with the dams for metro manila and its outlying cities we are providing support to those in the provinces we have also approved the water district development sector project under the local water utilities administration  you may have already heard of our largest ppp project—the laguna lakeshore expressway dike  —for which bidding will open before the end of  this is a project that will yield numerous benefits first flooding in nearby areas will lessen today when water levels of the laguna lake reach  meters surrounding co',\n",
       "  'mmunities will be flooded the solution a dike with a height of more than  meters \\xa0second the water of laguna lake will be cleaner third less traffic an expressway will be built on top of the dike which will extend from los baños to taguig when the  road that will connect to san jose del monte is completed we will have another route that will allow us to travel through metro manila without passing through edsa  with the cooperation of the private sector the only obligations we have in this project are for the rightofway and a portion of the reclaimed land will serve as payment for the highest bidder because of thiswe will get what we need while spending less in the process these are only a few examples of the projects that are in the pipeline and that will soon bring benefits to our bosses might i add—there are many more the neda board has likewise approved the laoag city bypass link road project the cebu bus rapid transit project and the lrt line  south extension and line  east extension for those of our countrymen from palawan apart from the projects for the puerto princesa airport there is also the busuanga airport to look forward to we have likewise given the go signal for the construction of phase one of the modern clark green city in capas tarlac that will certainly serve as a center for commerce and industry not only of central luzon but also of the entire country at the end of the day our vision for clark green city is that it becomes even bigger than the bonifacio global city formerly isolated places will now become areas teeming with opportunity through good governance we have been regaining the trust of the market of the world and of our own people in government this is creating a virtuous cycle seeing the results of our reform agenda has spurred the active participation of each and every one of our bosses indeed today the government is not alone in pushing for widespread and meaningful reform it is true that you are our strength  this is why boss we thank you for your trust and your solidarity both of which have become even more significant in the times when we were faced with tragedies that came to us one after the other in september of  lawless elements attacked zamboanga our countrymen who had been living peaceful lives there were used as human shields their homes were burned down this crisis tested the caliber of our uniformed services urban combat is considered the most complex kind of combat in spite of this our troops were able to save  of the  filipinos caught in the conflict we salute our countrymen in the uniformed services your sacrifice paved way for the victory of the filipino people  following the incident we gave secretary singson the responsibility of overseeing the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure in zamboanga the first priority to provide shelter to our countrymen who lost their homes to fire this is exactly what we are doing under the zamboanga city roadmap to recovery and reconstruction by this coming august affected families can begin to move into permanent housing units in martha drive subdivision we also aim to complete the construction of  housing units in other areas by june of next year i must ask for your understanding there were many problems surrounding the land for resettlement—problems we had to address on top of this we also had to make sure that the houses that would be built would be in accordance to the beliefs and culture of the beneficiaries these will not be ordinary houses on the other hand to the  families that wish to build back or repair their own homes  pesos worth of home materials assistance is now being distributed we have set aside  billion pesos for the rehabilitation of infrastructure the purchasing of lots the construction of permanent houses and other types of assistance for zamboanga  billion pesos from this fund has already been released to the nha and dpwh a few weeks after the crisis in zamboanga central visayas was rocked by an earthquake which left bohol the most devastated in the midst of a calamity we witnessed just what could be achieved when our people come together to respond to the challenges brought by a disaster for instance just one week after the earthquake electricity was restored in tagbilaran and in all the municipalities of bohol  now each of the  critical roads and bridges destroyed by the earthquake are passable  billion pesos has already been released for the rehabilitation of bohol and cebu  part of this is the  billion pesos that the dilg provided to the local government for the reconstruction of markets civic centers bridges water systems municipal halls and other government facilities before the end of  yolanda made landfall it was the strongest typhoon in history affecting  families and  out of our  provinces in eastern visayas where the damage was most severe so many issues required immediate attention the immense strength of the storm paralyzed many lgus that were hit directly the relief goods we prepositioned were swept away which is why relief had to come from areas farther away the delivery of aid was made all the more difficult by the destruction of infrastructure there was no electricity roads were impassable and almost all of the trucks and heavy equipment that our first responders needed had been destroyed in the areas most affected by yolandathere was no gasoline and there was no communication it required an enormous amount of solidarity to assist affected families take care of the wounded and of those who lost loved ones and make certain that there would be no outbreak of disease among many other responsibilities let us look at the delivery of food as an example it was not just a matter of buying rice and canned goods we needed repacking centers several trucks and boats that would bring aid to affected provinces when the relief goods arrived we had to be sure that the roads to the affected areas were cleared and that the trucks had enough gas to return home and load even more of our food packs your government wasted no time in responding we immediately cleared the airport which is why within  hours after the storm three  were able to bring in aid on that same day we were also able to set up a communications hub to hasten the flow of information on the second day the depa',\n",
       "  'rtment of healths rapid health assessment teams arrived as well as additional soldiers policemen and bfp personnel from other provinces likewise workers from dswd lead relief operations—in the distribution centers in eastern visayas or in repacking centers all around the country in a span of two days the leyte water district resumed operations on the third day the first gas station opened the main roads were immediately cleared by the  of november which was two weeks after the storm the one millionth food pack was distributed to the victims we had cleared  cubic meters of debris from these roads through which the relief will be transported and  kilometers of national roads had already been cleared and were passable at present we are repairing the  kilometers of destroyed roads bridges approaches and landslide prone areas by christmas day of  all municipalities affected by the calamity had been electrified  we took an emergency room mindset the state utilized its full strength to stabilize the patient in the soonest possible time i extend my gratitude to the members of the cabinet who led the government response in the affected communities secretary cesar purisima along with secretary joel villanueva of the technical education and skills development authority organized the logistics in the repacking center taking on the role of warehouse operator  secretary greg domingo of the department of trade and industry became the countrys head purchasing agent while secretary linda baldoz of the department of labor and employment served as a call center operator for all those who wished to help  i also thank secretary jun abaya of the department of transportation and communications who dispatched our transportation secretary dinky soliman who proved that she was worthy of being the countrys chief relief worker and secretaries mar roxas of the department of interior and local government and secretary volts gazmin of the department of national defense who were on the disaster frontline giving marching orders to our uniformed services  to the members of our cabinet thank you to our friends and neighbors around the world your outpouring of solidarity will never be forgotten by a grateful filipino people again on their behalf we thank you  perhaps given the filipino peoples readiness to render assistance to the best of our abilities—a characteristic embodied by our ofws peacekeepers and all our other countrymen abroad—when the world saw that we were in need they saw fit to come to our aid today we express once more our gratitude to all of you and to all the filipinos who have offered their prayers and their support whether here or in other parts of the world  our work did not end there we implemented livelihood interventions to ensure that those of our countrymen who survived the typhoon could recover at the soonest possible time this july  jobs were created after we turned over boats fishing and farming equipment seeds and livestock to our countrymen this includes those filipinos to whom we paid salaries for participating in the cash for work program perhaps everyone can agree that yolanda left in its wake a massive problem according to international standards whenever a calamity of this scale takes place it normally takes a country one year before it transitions from relief to rehabilitation however in just a span of eight months the united nations declared the philippines to be in the rehabilitation state in fact mr yuri afanasiev of the united nations development program said we have never seen a recovery happen so quickly and many of us have been in many different disasters  it will indeed take a long time for any country to recover and rise from massive calamities in haiti two years after the earthquake there are still many who live in evacuation centers for our brothers and sisters in indonesia it took eight years before they recovered from the tsunami in aceh and even in america it is said that it took eight years for things to return to normal after the devastation of hurricane katrina our work is not done there are still many houses that need to be constructed many more of our countrymen need to be assisted in getting back on their own two feet the work to build back better for all those affected by yolanda continues this is why this july the lgu rehabilitation and recovery plan for cebu iloilo eastern samar leyte and tacloban city was submitted to me and i have signed it  it passed the scrutiny of our cabinet clusters according to the holistic postdisaster needs assessment that was conducted the plan encapsulates the needs of our countrymen this plan was formulated as a result of the dedication of secretary ping lacson whom we tasked with focusing on the challenges left by yolanda  i am hoping for the cooperation of congress because a large sum is necessary in order to help our countrymen make a full recovery let us remember god proposes but man disposes this is likewise the idea behind our efforts for disaster preparedness we are strengthening the capabilities of our lgus who are the frontliners in times of disasters through a modern and comprehensive forecasting system through the dreamlidar project under project noah for instance we can more efficiently pinpoint areas that are prone to flooding  out of our targeted  river systems have already been mapped to determine which areas immediately suffer from the effects of torrential rain because we can more efficiently determine when and where typhoons will affect us today we are able to give our lgus sufficient warning—and thus give them ample time to prepare and to evacuate their constituents if we were to add the efficiency of lgus to our alreadyefficient forecasting system then without a doubt countless lives can be saved in albay which recently had to endure the wrath of typhoon glenda there were no recorded casualties attributed to the storm thanks to the effective leadership of governor joey salceda  and if a province that is considered a highway for storms can achieve this is there any doubt that any and all other lgus can achieve the same let us now talk about security we are aware of the challenges our country faces and we also know the high cost of the equipment we need today i am glad to report to you the ongoing moderniza',\n",
       "  'tion of the afp we have acquired brand new assets including  sokol combat utility helicopters   helicopters and the first landing craft utility ship built right here in the country the brp tagbanua  refurbished  helicopters and  navy cutters have also arrivedthis past may we also inaugurated the naval forces wests stateoftheart command center in palawan next year  out of the   leadin fighter jets we procured will arrive in the country  we expect the rest to be delivered in  we are also targeting the acquisition of an additional  bell combat utility helicopters  antisubmarine helicopters  more  helicopters  lightlift aircraft  mediumlift aircrafts radar systems all of which are brand new these along with other new equipment will boost the capacity of our armed forces meanwhile we are expecting the delivery of  additional refurbished  helicopters by september of this year the  assault rifles we bought for our soldiers have likewise arrived in the next few months the total number of rifles that will be in the hands of our soldiers  units on top of this through a correct and transparent procurement process and the honest management of funds we were able to save more than  billion pesos  which we will use to purchase even more rifles i must emphasize all these rifles are brand new and of good quality from a veteran manufacturer was it not true that before our funds were depleted in the purchase of kevlar helmets that were not even according to specification instead of buying them from the us these helmets were purchased from another country there has already been a conviction over this matter the investigation of a judge who was allegedly involved which was ordered by the supreme court has been concluded as well and we are awaiting their verdict we are continuing our pursuit of enemies of the state and lawless elements for the crimes they have committed for example we apprehended the chairman and secretary general of the npa this march normality and order are now returning to the  provinces previously troubled by the npa the image of our police has changed proof of this are the  policemen led by inspector charity galvez who repelled an estimated  npa members who stormed their precinct in   just last march four rookie policewomen bravely exchanged fire with the martilyo gang in the mall of asia it is indeed fortunate that we have already reached a  policetopistol ratio which is why these rookie policewomen were issued brand new guns before the needs of our police force went ignored today the state is taking care of them and indeed they are matching this support with efficient and upright service  let us listen to our brave policewomen testimonials of juliet macababbad marcelina bantiyag maricel rueco and delia langpawen—policewomen who arrested members of the martilyo gang  juliet macababbad we heard glass breaking and my partner and i immediately went on alert  marcelina bantiyag the first thing that came to my mind was to draw my gun because i knew that they would be ready to shoot at us—we were in uniform  maricel rueco my partner  bantiyag said ill cover you call our police community precinct  marcelina bantiyag we caught one of the gang members  delia langpawen it was only our fourth day on the job at that post and then that happened  juliet macababbad every police officer needs a gun thankfully they issued us a glock  generation   marcelina bantiyag guns are essential to us if something bad happens when youre on patrol youre confident that you can engage  juliet macababbad \\xa0it feels good when you know youre able to help your fellow citizens whatever a man can do a woman can do just as well  delia langpawen even if we were nervous because it was our first encounter we were thinking of the safety of all the people that were there \\xa0 this past june we had a succession of highprofile killings we have already arrested some of thoseinvolved in the murders of mayor ernesto balolong and businessman richard king and are currently following a strong lead in the murder case of race car driver ferdinand pastor rest assured we are seeking justice for all and not just for a few this is why on top of the arrests we have already made we continue to gather evidence against other suspects we will hold to account all those who have committed wrongdoing  we are further strengthening ways to ensure the security of our citizens beginning june  of this year we implemented operation lambat in the national capital region after tripling the number of checkpoints and conducting various operations we were able to confiscate  vehicles and  firearms we have served  warrants of arrest which have resulted in the arrest of  suspects we also reinstated oplan katok to ensure that the licensing of guns is limited to responsible owners our policemen knocked on  doors for this operation before we implemented operation lambat from january to the second week of june the rate of murder and homicide cases in metro manila reached up to  cases a week during the five weeks of operation lambat murder and homicide cases decreased to only  cases per week this is a  percent decrease equivalent to nine murders prevented per week and this is only in metro manila if we are able to pass pension reform which would enable us to gather even more funds to continue our planned purchases of equipment then secretary mar roxas will certainly be able to expand operation lambat and thus make the whole country more secure  these equipment purchases were supposed to be funded by dap but since they were not obligated before the supreme court made its decision we now have to look for other sources of funds indeed trust is the foundation of good governance the trust that all those who were affected—or who will be affected—by typhoons will be cared for the trust that after each day of work you will be able to return home safely to your families the trust that your leaders will not take advantage of you the trust that government will always be by your side especially when you find yourselves at a disadvantage the trust that those who abuse their power will be held accountable and the trust that the institutions and processes that were once abused and used to steal from the nations coffers will be reformed the trust that if you do what is right you',\n",
       "  ' in turn will receive what you deserve the restoration of your trust in government this is the meaning of reform  let me give you an example customs which had been sorely testing our patience these past years it became clear to us that the solution to the problem this agency represented was a reset button thus we created a new agency to look into the processes at customs with an eye towards making them more efficient we appointed a new commissioner five new deputy commissioners as well as  trustworthy individuals to implement our reforms we ensured that employees were recalled to their original positions—we put a stop to guards who acted like cashiers or warehousemen who acted as examiners many have made sacrifices just so we can fix customs among them are officials from other departments and government agencies who we asked to transfer to customs because we were certain of their integrity who would have said yes to taking on these seemingly insurmountable challenges and without the guarantee of success some passed on promotions some expressed fears of being targeted by syndicates in retaliation for the reforms but ultimately they heeded our call to serve it is only right that i take this opportunity to personally thank these officials under the leadership of commissioner sunny sevilla  we are proving that with righteousness and with solidarity we can clean up an institution that has for the longest time been besmirched by corruption recent good news is testament to this—from january to april of  customs cash collections increased by  percent compared to the same period last year their collections total in the first four months of the year  billion pesos  all i can say to those who continue with their selfish illegal practices i already know that you are impervious to both fear and shame i will leave you to your conscience—if you feel any remorse for your fellowmen who have become addicted to the illegal drugs you have helped to smuggle in or for the farmers who are being deprived of fair profit from doing honest work as far as i am concerned after we have gathered enough evidence against you the bilibid prison is your next destination  if we are talking about reforms that have already begun to give rise to sweeping progress we have to touch on recent developments in agrarian reform we know—and the law is very clear about this—that we must first determine which tracts of land can be distributed and which cannot the trouble is we were provided with data too insufficient to be of any help in this regard the cadastral survey—which was supposed to accurately delineate the territory and thus the land holdings of every town city and province of the philippines—was launched way back in  another problem is that the previous administration had distributed land that was easy enough to distribute—like governmentowned land or land already settled between the farmers and the deedholders we were left with land that came with too many complications—that only spawned endless debates and legal disputes the complicated situation in armm proved to be another challenge the land in armm is estimated to be at  million hectares but the recorded number of hectares we found when we came into office was at  million thanks to overlapping claims \\xa0armm governor mujiv hataman must be wondering—as he has sometimes asked me how does land multiply like that i have no intention of passing on these problems to my successor which will cause even greater complications and a standstill in agrarian reform in  after  years the cadastral survey will finally be completed  this year we will once again submit to congress a bill extending the filing of notices of coverage which could not be completed precisely because of these problems that we first needed to solve  we are hopeful that the moment we file that bill congress will pass it in the soonest possible time if we are to speak of trust then we cannot forget about the bangsamoro after a lengthy period of conflict and derailed negotiations we were able to put trust back to the table proof of this this past march the comprehensive agreement on the bangsamoro was signed  but this is only the beginning of the path toward widespread progress in mindanao nobody can deny that the armm has been left behind in terms of development we want to give equal opportunities to all filipinos this is why there is a need for a boostup so that our countrymen in the margins can catch up for example in the budget we are submitting for   billion pesos of the overall budget for dpwh has been allocated for infrastructure in armm  we are currently forging the proposal for the bangsamoro basic law we ask for the congress understanding regarding this it is important to scrutinize each provision we lay down to the best of our ability we aim to advance a bill that is fair just and acceptable to all  if we are able to legislate the bangsamoro basic law before the end of the year and conduct the necessary plebiscite we will be able to give the bangsamoro transition authority one and a half years to show positive change should this be delayed however the period for proving that it was right to choose the path of peace will naturally be shortened we have achieved a lot through trust—and we have no intention of breaking this trust your current government keeps its word i will no longer list each of the promises we have fulfilled by treading the straight path if i do that we might be accused of bragging but of course it would not be right for us to avoid mentioning anything because our critics are always waiting for an opportunity to say that we have done nothing join me then in recounting some of the examples of these promises we have fulfilled jobs and opportunities that continue to be created for so many filipinos in truth from april  to april  around  million jobs were created  the inherited backlog in books chairs and classrooms erased while we are working to fulfill the new needs brought about by the implementation of k to  the  policetopistol ratio has already reached the modernization of the armed forces

healthca',\n",
       "  're classrooms jobs harbors roads airports security peace in addition to the national integrity we have restored is the worlds recognition of a new philippines the nations coffers which come from the sweat of our citizens are being spent only for their benefit \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 let us again listen to one of our bosses testimonial of gina lastrado relocated member of an informalsettler family i am gina lastrado  years old i used to live at isla  barangay  in maricaban pasay city i was a businesswoman back in pasay currently i still make a living selling goods its a job that demands hard work we were relocated here because the place we used to live was tagged a danger zone—most of the houses were right beside a river when typhoon ondoy  hit it was terrible you wouldnt have believed that we would survive \\xa0 if you compare our lives back in pasay to our lives now—here it rains it storms but you can sleep through a night theres no lying awake worrying about the coming flood—not like where we used to live which is why i told my friends those who stayed behind to relocate too here theres no fear theres no flood when we got here they gave us groceries they gave us the key to the house then they brought us to our house and the eighteen thousand pesos they gave us that helped us start a new life this gave us back our dignity all of us who were living in the squatters area back in pasay our lives are much better here you can say that this is really our home now now the problems we inherited we have solved the problems that are here today we are solving and the problems that are still on the horizon we are preparing for i believe with your continued trust we can solve all of these let us turn to the energy situation we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the growing energy demand in our country is met in spite of this there have been some unforeseen events that may lead to problems in the next year for instance we need to make up for the shortages caused by the scheduled maintenance outages of old plants the sudden halting of plant operations due to breakdowns and delays in the progress of new plants let us not forget that the coming el niño season also threatens to affect the capacities of our hydro power plants and to raise energy demand even further if our use of electric fans and air conditioners in our own homes will increase due to the warm temperature then imagine the spike in the usage of businesses and whole industries and it is not as if we can just go to the store and ask to buy a  megawatt generator to be installed the following day we want to be completely ready so that we can avoid paralysis if the worstcase scenario arises the goal to have planned solutions for problems that will not arise until next year this is precisely why i have tasked secretary icot petilla of the doe to coordinate with the joint congressional power commission the energy regulatory commission members of industry and most importantly the consumers in order to increase our capacity to respond to this problem i am also aware that many of our bosses are affected by the staggering increase in rice prices it seems that the reports are true that some greedy rice hoarders are stockpiling their supplies in order to sell them when prices eventually rise making an unjust profit in the process we will not let this pass perhaps they think they are being clever but the governments plan of action will prove the opposite our immediate solution import more rice supply it to the markets reduce the prices and keep them at a reasonable level and ultimately drive those who took advantage of the filipino people into financial ruin  last november we imported  metric tons of rice to supplement decreased supply due to the typhoons that battered our country and all of this had arrived by march of this year this february the nfa council approved the importation of an additional  metric tons in fulfillment of our buffer stocking requirement and as of this july  of this amount had arrived this july as well we approved the immediate importation of  metric tons of rice through open bidding the nfa also has the standby authority to import an additional  metric tons to prepare for the effects of calamities on harvests and rice prices when the additional rice we have imported arrives in the country hoarders will be forced to sell the rice that they have stockpiled in their warehouses to these hoarders if a showdown is what you want by all means take on the government just remember it only takes six months before the stock you have hoarded in your warehouses begins to rot when we flood the market with this imported rice you will surely go bust you are acting against the filipino people while we are acting for the interest of each filipino let us see who will prevail  apart from investigating those who have allegedly hoarded nfa rice we are also probing all those in concerned agencies who may have conspired with these hoarders employees suspected of wrongdoing are already under scrutiny so that we may file charges and eventually imprison those who must be held to account while we are in pursuit of those abusive few we have also continued to implement projects to uplift filipinos in the sector of agriculture we are ensuring that rice farming remains a viable and attractive livelihood after all we know that our farmers are advancing in age which is why it will help our pursuit of food security to encourage the youth to enter this kind of work we are providing our farmers with modern equipment to ensure the efficiency of planting and harvest from  to may  we have already turned over  units of production machinery  units of postproduction machinery and  rice mills to a number of farmers associations this has allowed us to lessen waste in what our farmers are able to harvest on top of this we are also enhancing irrigation systems constructing farmtomarket roads and implementing training programs to ensure that they make the maximum profit now let us turn to the budget the executive branch proposes projects which are approved by congress however we have had to suspend a number of projects to make certain that we remain in accordance with the supreme courts decision on the disbursement acceleration program or dap i know that those of you in this ',\n",
       "  'hall are one with me in believing that we must not deprive our countrymen of benefits and that these should reach them in the soonest possible time this is why we are proposing the passage of a supplemental budget for  so that the implementation of our programs and projects need not be compromised  together with this we are calling on the cooperation of congress for the passage of a joint resolution that will bring clarity to the definitions and ideas still being debated upon and to the other issues that only you in the legislature—as the authors of our laws—can shed light on  on the first working day after the sona we will submit to congress the proposed  trillion peso national budget of  as always this budget was created together with our countrymen using strategies that will ensure that funds are only allocated to projects and programs that will truly benefit the public we are counting on the cooperation of our lawmakers to strengthen our budget as the primary instrument in creating opportunities for the filipino people let us now listen to one of the beneficiaries of our alternative learning system a program of the department of education testimonial of maria cecilla fruelda—aeta tribal leader alternative learning system learner and college student i am maria cecilla fruelda i heard from my friends who also came from zambales and who are now living here in rosario that there are good jobs to be found in puting kahoy thats why we moved here our first priority as tribespeople has always been to look for food rather than to invest time in our education but education is very important to me passing the alternative learning system als was the first step in realizing my dream of becoming a teacher i think that young aetas in my community would have much better lives if only they could study if i hadnt gotten into als i wouldnt have learned about our rights as indigenous peoples we wouldnt be able to fight for our ancestral land right now thank god the national commission on indigenous peoples is processing land titles to be awarded to us once i graduate with a degree in education i want to teach in our community i want to share with the aeta community everything ive learned and more the als has been such a great help my being a student of teodoro m luansing college of rosario has helped bring more attention to our community a lot of people have offered to help i see our communitys children following in my footsteps a lot of them are in school now fellow citizens it is her story—and the stories of many other beneficiaries like her—that is drowned out by the din of the orchestra of negativism in the news these noisy individuals willfully close off their minds and choose to live in their own world and reality as the transformation of society becomes even more apparent these people are acting just how we expect them to their attacks on us are becoming more frequent more venomous and more intense as the benefits of reform become clearer it becomes more and more difficult for them to succeed in fooling the people which is why they are sowing doubt and uncertainty they have become desperate why are they so angry let us examine their motivations for those who turned public service into a business if we are able to fix our systems they lose the opportunity to subvert these systems for their own gain it is only natural that they oppose us on the other hand for those who have no other goal than to overthrow government they can only recruit members when agreat number of people are suffering and losing faith in the system this is why with a reformed system that has ended the peoples suffering the number of potential recruits has dwindled which explains why their group is getting smaller and smaller it is only natural that they oppose us the noisiest and loudest of those who oppose us are not in favor of the transformation of our country precisely because they manipulated and benefited from the old and broken systems it was as if we were citizens who had been long trapped in an island with only one store since there were no other choices the store owners abused their advantage raising prices whenever they wanted the task you gave me was to steer our ship of state to another island where there were more stores more choices better lives and more opportunities of course those running the solitary store in the island did not want us to set sail because they will run out of people to abuse they would do everything in their power to prevent us from reaching other shores they would say that it is no different there and that nothing would change they would detain us at the port punch holes in our ship and conspire to steer us astray the truth is that i am not the one these people oppose but the entire filipino people who are now reaping the benefits of the straight path they oppose the farmers in iloilo who have hoped for efficient irrigation systems for more than fifty years and today are witnessing the construction of the jalaur multipurpose river project  they oppose the countless students who no longer have to study in overcrowded classrooms they oppose the filipinos who have found jobs because of training received from tesda the filipinos who have been safely evacuated before typhoons strike because pagasa is now more efficient they oppose the informal settlers who have been removed from danger because of housing resettlement programs they oppose the poor who can receive treatment from public hospitals free of charge they oppose the soldiers who because their equipment has been modernized can now protect our nation with greater confidence they oppose the moros and indigenous peoples who today see a just and lasting peace on the horizon my bosses they are against you  in fact their attacks began even before we came into office we have grown used to being greeted by negative commentators for breakfast personal attacks for lunch insults for dinner and intrigue for a midnight snack  and even now that i am president those opposed to change have not changed their ways to be frank i do not think that they will stop even when i have stepped down from public office i recall an old woman who i spoke to during the campaign she told me noy you must take care of yourself you will be up against many people her',\n",
       "  ' warning proved to be true but my resolve is unshakeable when it comes to facing them down because i know they are but a few and there are so many of us  those of us who are ready to fulfill our part in achieving positive transformation are without doubt stronger we will triumph because we are in the right we dared to dream we began pursuing those dreams we worked hard we gained the momentum and today the filipino people are moving even faster along the straight path to lasting and inclusive growth  our fatigue and sacrifices will be all the more worthwhile if you are able to continue what we started together it is you who will face a fork in the road it is you who will decide if change will continue let us remember this my fifth sona only one remains in  you will be choosing new leaders of our country what i can tell you is this if you wish continue and even accelerate the transformation of society there can only be one basis for choosing my successor who will without a shred of doubt continue the transformation we are achieving  you are our bosses you are our strength you are bringing about change –and so it is you too who will continue the task it is entirely up to you how history will remember this era they may recall it as the very peak of our triumphs as a promising start that went to waste but it would be infinitely better if they remember our achievements as the beginning of a long journey towards the fulfillment of even more ambitious hopes when some groups appealed to me to run for president they told me that they did not expect to solve all the countrys problems in a span of six years they simply asked me to begin the change you saw where we came from and you are seeing how we have far surpassed the aspirations with which we began we are forging a system of fairness where as long as you follow the rules you can get to where you want to go where true competition leads to opportunity and widespread progress where each and every person can take control of their own destinies  a society where the least fortunate are cared for is within reach where each person recognizes his responsibilities to his fellowmen where there is an unceasing untiring everactive participation in collectively increasing the prosperity of society the future we desire is on the horizon one where justice reigns supreme and where no one will be left behind these are the results of reform this is what we have fought for and this is what we will continue fighting for not the prevalence of the old ways but a new system that will benefit all  to my bosses you gave me an opportunity to lead our efforts to transform society if i had said no when you asked me to take on this challenge then i could just as well have said that i would help prolong your suffering i cannot do that in good conscience if i had turned my back on the opportunity then i might as well have turned my back on my father and mother and all the sacrifices they made for all of us that will not happen on our journey along the straight path you have always chosen what is right and just you have been true to your promise and i have been true to all of you  the transformation we are experiencing now we can make permanent with the guidance of god as long as your faith remains strong—as long as we continue serving as each others strength—we will continue proving that the filipino is worth\\xa0definitely dying for the filipino is worth living for and if i might add the filipino is worth fighting for the vice president knows this—we were together in  there was a coup de etat and i was ambushed everything after that i consider my second life its hard not to think about these things considering the people weve been going up against will there be a day when i go onstage for work and—will someone manage to plant a bomb will the dark schemes of those who want to bring us back to the wrong way of doing things finally succeed when that day comes and my second life comes to an end will i be able to say things will be ok i will tell you this straight in eye after everything weve achieved i can say that i am content i am content because i am sure that when im gone many will take my place and continue what we have started maybe this is what im meant to do to start this there are people like cardinal chito tagle ka eduardo manalo brother eddie villanueva father catalino arevalo and father jett villarin bishop jonel milan sister agnes guillen and mae salvatierra these are individuals from the religious sector who will continue what weve started  there is aris alip of card who will do his part through microfinance there is an alice murphy and her urban poor associates who will truly continue to take care of our informal settlers  there are our soldiers and police officers who try every day to do what is right—just like our new chief of staff our service commanders our soldiers in the light reaction battalion and the jsog there are of course my fellow politicians is there any doubt that senate president franklin drilon and speaker belmonte will lead us along the right path  it has also been my privilege to work with and interact with a certain governor alfredo maranon of negros occidental  he is not a party mate but \\xa0i think i am part of his fan club because of his good governance in negros there are up and coming young politicians or at least theyre younger than i am—i dont want to seem too much like an old politico by referring to my colleagues as young these are the likes of mayor jed mabilog and mayor len alonte  there is also those in the cultural sector—such as noel cabangon and ogie alcasid—who are not selfcentered  every night before i go to bed i am thankful that i was able to get through another day just as it was said when we were kids finished or not finished pass your paper it seems to me you have felt the true extent of the change that is every filipinos right to aspire to it will be up to you to carry this forward  to my bosses you are behind the transformation we are enjoying you are the key to continuing all the positive changes we have achieved i fully believe that whether i am here or not the filipino is headed towards the rightful destination and so i will leave it here good afternoon to all of you thank you very much   basahin ayon sa pagkakabig'],\n",
       " ['  benigno s aquino iii  thank you everyone please sit down before i begin i would first like to apologize i wasnt able to do the traditional processional walk or shake the hands of those who were going to receive me as i am not feeling too well right now vice president jejomar binay former presidents fidel valdez ramos and joseph ejercito estrada senate president franklin drilon and members of the senate speaker feliciano belmonte jr and members of the house of representatives chief justice maria lourdes sereno and our justices of the supreme court distinguished members of the diplomatic corps members of the cabinet local government officials members of the military police and other uniformed services my fellow public servants and to my bosses my beloved countrymen good afternoon to you all  this is my sixth sona once again i face congress and our countrymen to report on the state of our nation more than five years have passed since we put a stop to the culture of wangwang not only in our streets but in society at large since we formally took an oath to fight corruption to eradicate poverty and since the filipino people our bosses learned how to hope once more my bosses this is the story of our journey along the straight path just last friday we inaugurated the muntinlupacavite expressway this is the first publicprivate partnership project that we approved and the first such ppp project opened to the public under our administration under the previous administrations it was as if the government had to beg the private sector just to gain their participation now companies are the ones seemingly courting the government—for mcx in particular we were paid a premium of  million just so that our private partner could have the privilege of building the infrastructure we need in fact they are so confident that this project will earn them a profit that they said the first month of toll operations at mcx is free we have indeed come so far and in order for us to appreciate just how far we have travelled let us recall where we started when we came into office we found a citizenry that had grown desensitized to the many allegations of lying cheating and stealing in government those in power boasted of the country having enough classrooms in truth classes had to be held in four shifts students went to school while it was still dark and others would go home long after the dark of night had well and truly fallen all of them were left in the dark because they were not accorded sufficient time in the classroom for learning our predecessor took pride in uninterrupted growth during her last sona scrutinize what she said however and you would realize that a significant portion of this growth was fueled by remittances from filipinos who had lost hope in our country as they say people were voting with their feet if i were to imitate that style of governance i would be loath to claim a success borne of forcing my countrymen to escape our shores as the  elections approached more than  million were allegedly used to buy fertilizer that was not suitable for crops the endeavor was costly and in many instances the farmers who should have received the farming supplements never saw it we ask who was nourished by such fertilizers definitely neither the farmers nor their crops perhaps you also remember the nbnzte scandal we investigated this in the senate someone said there was an attempt to bribe him when we undertook an inquiry this person did not want to testify he claimed executive privilege of course we couldnt summon the sitting president—hence the only one we could question was her henchman accused of bribery naturally he denied the accusation during those times even children became familiar with the word scam you might also remember hello garci to which the answer was a mere i am sorry the genuine bank accounts of the nonexistent jose pidal the attempt to convene a constitutional assembly so that they could stay in power for the rest of their lives there was executive order  which tried to stifle the truth the declaration of a state of emergency in order to do away with the checks and balances for martial law as enshrined in the  constitution there were midnight appointments the policy known as calibrated preemptive response which was used against protesters even on the level of grammar this is wrong how could a response come before anything else its like saying you replied to someone who never texted you these were the headlines that greeted us every time we had breakfast in the years before we came into office the moment we assumed the presidency we began to unearth anomaly after anomaly in my previous sonas i have already mentioned some of them in the national food authority they allowed the debt to bloat from  billion pesos in  to  billion in june  even worse they continued to import rice only to have it rot in warehouses in pagcor a billion pesos went to coffee in the mwss excessive bonuses one on top of the other for the laguna lake an attempt to waste over  billion just to play with mud indeed i could not comprehend how those behind such controversies could willingly benefit from the suffering of our countrymen every government official takes an oath to do right by our countrymen and to uphold the law but it was clear our predecessor did precisely the opposite we were all witnesses to the most appalling example when  filipinos were massacred in maguindanao in november  to think about committing such a crime was already heinous to do it which they did was even worse the worst offense of all their belief that they could get away with it because they were in power—which is why they carried out their plans in the first place these are only a few examples there are many others with this kind of situation can we really blame our countrymen for losing sight of hope and consequently leaving our country like you the thought of giving up had crossed my mind when my mother died my confidence diminished further our familys leader and inspiration to pursue change was gone at her wake someone approached me and suggested that i run for the presidency my immediate response i am not a masochist i was one of the people calling for an end to impunity and wrongdoing i understood just how dire the situation was i was also certain they had deliberately hidden details from us and the real problems were bigger than what we knew when you called me to serve my question was if i am unable to solve these problems quickly how long will it take before my bosses lose their patience and instead direct all their anger at me one of those who convinced me to run was alex lacson he said to simply put an end to all the abuse would suffice to stop the hemorrhaging would be enough let us listen to him translated transcript of testimonial of alex lacson in  our country was ranked by the world bank as one of the most corrupt in the world our selfconfidence and morale as a people were very low at the time many of my friends and i were looking for a good man not just a good politician to be our president in  then president cory passed away and senator noynoy spoke at her funeral that is when we truly saw him my friends encouraged me to lead the public call to urge senator noynoy to run for president my friends and i went to the house of senator noynoy in times street we brought a yellow drum and we encouraged the public to write letters within  hours there was an outpouring of public support for senator noynoy to run for public office i did not expect him to be superman and solve all our problems in the country we expected him only to begin reform mr president thank you for heeding the call of the people in  and thank you too for respecting my beliefs even as we disagreed on a number of issues mr president continue to lead our country on the right path  from the start we already knew that corruption was the root of all our peoples suffering thus our battle cry where there is no corruption there will be no poverty tremendous perseverance courage political will and faith in god and in our fellowmen were needed in order to breathe life into this ideal of course the masterminds of the old system were not meek lambs willing to see the end of their opportunity to take advantage of others they used and continue to use their influence and wealth to fight our agenda of change they also used their power to prepare life preservers for when the time of judgment came the ombudsman who should have been appointed to guard against corruption allegedly played blind to all the scandals of the past administration she was impeached in the house of representatives and resigned from her post before she could be tried in the senate the chief justice who seemed to have a bias for the one who appointed him was proven to have hidden wealth and properties not disclosed in his saln he was impeached in the house and convicted in the senate to replace them we appointed men and women with integrity and independent minds the new ombudsman conchita carpiomorales the new chief justice ma lourdes sereno now she has sufficient time to implement reform in the judiciary  even in other agencies we appointed honest and fearless leaders we immediately placed chairperson grace pulidotan in the coa in the executive we likewise appointed uncompromising persons commissioner kim henares in the bir a',\n",
       "  'nd secretary leila de lima  in the department of justice they did not back down from any challenge in fulfilling their mandates to all of you i give my heartfelt thanks whether in the top middle or bottom of the bureaucracy so many have been suspended removed from their positions made accountable through cases filed against them or even imprisoned if there is anyone who still doubts that justice is blind in the philippines it would be best if they turned their attention to the three senators currently detained or to a former president still under hospital arrest there are some who say we should move on personally i believe in what george santayana said those who forget the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat it just take a look at the actions of those who have wronged us they will first work to ensure we forget what they have done after this they will say have pity on us they already took advantage of us now they are trying to take advantage of the filipinos innate penchant for forgiveness in order to escape accountability the next step they will find a way to return to power isnt that their master plan—so that they can continue to take advantage of us i learned from my parents from the church and from the processes of our laws whatever reconciliation must come from the confession and repentance of those who have committed wrong can you remember an instance in which anyone said im sorry i stole from you and abused you i am ready to change for my part we can only move on once justice has been attained  we continued to reform our institutions in order to refocus them towards their true mandates for example government owned and controlled corporations appointees to goccs swore to safeguard our peoples money the sad fact is even when the goccs were mired in debt they showered themselves with benefits and incentives left and right if we liken their institutions to cattle theyd just as soon butcher the cow for meat even as they milk it this is why in the past administration dividends collected over nine and a half years only amounted to  billion under our administration the number of goccs has already been reduced by shutting down those deemed irrelevant and yet because of improved management the dividends we have collected in the five years we have been in office have now reached  billion  it isnt unlikely that before we step down from office we will be able to double the dividends collected by our predecessor who had much more time to accumulate these funds  this is the same commitment we have shown in the bir which is the biggest revenuegenerating agency of the government when we stepped in the highest collection on record was in  at  billion we surpassed this by leaps and bounds in  the bir collected  trillion—the first time in our history we have breached the  trillion mark for collections  last year the number went up to  trillion this  we will collect up to  trillion  we only needed five years to match surpass and almost double our predecessors record high—and we did this without imposing new taxes as promised apart from sin tax reform  how did we do this it was simple i believe that commissioner kim henares is a kind person but those against whom she filed cases might have a different opinion commissioner kim henares spared no tax evader   cases have already been filed against those who attempted to evade taxes she also made the system for tax payment more efficient and made clear to everyone their civic duty to contribute to the development of our country for the national budget under the previous administration the budget was always reenacted whether partially or fully in  for example it was almost april when the general appropriations act gaa was approved it was already worrying that projects that had been completed received funding once more even worse even the maintenance and other operating expenses including salaries were included in this reenacted budget what this means funds were allotted again for salaries—even if all had already received what was due them for the first three months of  i wonder where did the excess funds that were allotted and requested for go what we have proven if the executive proposes a reasonable budget the dialogue with the members of congress will go smoothly the faster the gaa is passed the quicker services will reach our countrymen and the sooner will we be able to alleviate their suffering the message was clear we are serious about change the playing field is level the result confidence in our economy when we began i did not think that we would immediately win back the global communitys confidence in the philippines i only thought of fixing the crooked system to prevent our people from sinking deeper into poverty let me ask you did it ever occur to you that we would continue rising in global competitiveness rankings and that we would be recognized for the speed with which our economy has grown in fact the philippines is now being called asias rising tiger asias rising star and asias bright spot  now for the first time in history we are unanimously deemed investment grade by the most prominent credit rating agencies this is a signal to businessmen that it is worthwhile to invest in the philippines the risks of doing business here have decreased now with lower interest rates and more flexible debt payment schedules more investors are finding it attractive to bet on the philippines through the institution and expansion of businesses commerce becomes more lively competition strengthens and even more opportunities are created all this has been a direct result of reforms we made along the straight path  just look back in  net foreign direct investment in our country was at  billion in  net foreign direct investments reached  billion  this is the highest ever recorded in our entire history the numbers for domestic investments are likewise impressive now filipinos are betting on their fellow filipinos let us compare from the time this was first measured back in  until  the amount of approved domestic investments totaled just  trillion under our watch from the third quarter of  until the end of  the amount invested by our countrymen in the market reached  trillion  in manufacturing i admit during my first year in office one of the things furthest from my mind was the idea that we could reinvigorate this sector the industry faced many challenges electricity for one was both expensive and unreliable it was also no small feat to establish facilities here because of the large investment involved in buying machines and training employees this is why back then we had to import even lowtech electric fans thanks to the reforms that have restored confidence in our nation manufacturing growth has accelerated—from  percent annually between  and  to  percent from  to   it is clear the filipino can compete in the past our only selling point was low wages now investors are bringing to our country factories that produce hitech equipment from aircraft components electric tricycles printers and other digital media products to highquality medical devices like aortic catheters and devices for in vitro diagnostics and hemodialysis treatment let us listen to a businessman who will tell us of the new business climate in the philippines translated transcript of testimonial of peter perfecto makati business club one of the most important things this administration has accomplished was reversing the corruption trends of the previous administration without the rule of law the advantage went to corporations that were complicit with the systemic bribery and a faulty tax system president aquino has walked the talk he has delivered on his promises they arrested the former president the three senators and ousted a chief justice who were all once thought to be untouchable the strong message has been sent because of the rule of law and the commitment to good governance this administration has made our foreign direct investments rose from  billion to  billion we have made a huge leap forward jumping  places in the rankings set by the world economic forum and according to them this is a result of this administrations anticorruption agenda—all because of the changes that this government has enacted it is the responsibility of each filipino to learn from these recent achievements and ensure that we continue moving forward with the coming administration  we all know that the primary measure of economic improvement for the common filipino is the creation of jobs let us look at what weve achieved in this area every year around  new entrants join our labor force now consider the fact that there are reports of overseas filipinos returning home in  our department of foreign affairs reported that there were around  million overseas filipinos based on the latest estimates in december  that number went down to  million it is reasonable to say that a good number of the estimated  filipinos represented by that decrease came home and were able to find work  despite the fact that there are new entrants returnees and previously unemployed filipinos our unemployment rate still dropped to  percent last year this is the lowest recorded in a decade  let me be clear we created permanent jobs we did not hire an abundance of street sweepers during the period the labor survey was conducted just to boost results',\n",
       "  ' together with creating real jobs we are also fostering a good relationship between labor and management throughout the country let us compare in the nine and a half years of the previous administration the number of strikes that occurred were  or roughly  strikes for each year in our five years in office the total strikes were only   in fact in  there was only a single strike recorded in the country this is the lowest recorded in the history of dole  it is because of this that we are truly impressed with secretary linda baldoz and our labor and management sector  to sec linda you are not only efficient you are also very positive which makes you the type of colleague who is a pleasure to work with that is why you are considered the pastor of the cabinet thank you very much for all your efforts linda  the transformation has indeed been vast before the signs we would always see proclaimed no vacancy didnt they today announcements that say for immediate hiring are scattered everywhere you need only open a newspaper to see classified ads from many companies who are hiring some of them have even been getting creative with incentives theres this one company that says just come in for an interview and your breakfast is on them once youre hired theyll cover your treat to friends and family to celebrate your new job some businessmen have even mentioned to me that they are finding it difficult to hire accountants i remember when i was younger a lot of people were taking up bs commerce major in accountancy when i visited bicol university i mentioned this to their president i had to ask am i correct in the knowledge that your university has an accountancy program their reply yes but even we are having trouble filling our accounting department why their president said that their students even in their third year of college are already being recruited by accounting and auditing firms  this is happening precisely because we have worked to address what is called the jobskills mismatch in the past so many of our countrymen were saying that they had no jobs even when there were so many unfilled positions listed in the philjobnet website the simple reason the skillset of our countrymen did not match what the market needed the solution to this was also simple talk to prospective employers and ask them what skills are demanded by the positions they are opening now it is in these skills that we train filipinos so that they can maximize opportunities the principle behind our strategy of governance instead of giving our countrymen fish we will teach them how to fish we are ensuring that the progress we have made and the opportunities that have been created can be maximized by our fellowmen we cannot wait for the benefits of growth to trickle down to the poorest filipinos we cannot leave it to chance or hope for the best our commitment inclusive growth the agenda assistance knowledge skills training and health to ensure that no one is left behind one of our mechanisms the pantawid pamilyang pilipino program we have vastly expanded the scope of this program now more than  million households are feeling the benefits of this program  this is extremely far from the  households covered by the program when we entered office this year  graduated from high school they are part of the first batch of beneficiaries under the expanded pantawid pamilya  of these youth graduated with honors and a variety of awards  in fact the two beneficiaries i met were accepted into civil engineering a quota course in the university of the philippines all of these beneficiaries will gain important knowledge instead of entering menial jobs once they graduate it is almost certain that they will find jobs that will pay them a decent salary their income tax alone will repay the states investment and we will be able to continue the cycle of empowering those in need the brighter future that awaits the honor students the program assisted is just an added bonus let us listen to one of those assisted by pantawid pamilya translated transcript of testimonial of alyannah cct beneficiary i work much harder now i knew the trials my family faced because of poverty when we were enrolled in the conditional cash transfer program i saw that people wanted to help us i knew they wanted nothing in return—but for me the only way i could repay their kindness was through my studies the money we get from the government was never wasted we were able to finance all of my school expenses i was so happy when i got into my dream school the university of the philippines the cct program gave me a chance to get a good education which helped me finish high school and now im on my way to college i know this program is on the receiving end of a lot of criticism but i want to tell president benigno aquino that they need only to look at me—at us we are proof that the money set aside by the government for this program is not a doleout the money goes towards a worthy pursuit which i know one day will help uplift the entire country  under pantawid pamilya in exchange for assistance the primary focus of beneficiaries must be the education of their children this has already borne early fruit according to studies conducted by the philippine institute for development studies in  there were  million outofschool children in the country the years passed and our population grew but in  only  million outofschool children remained let me emphasize the difference  million  its as if we filled around  empty classrooms with students of course apart from the pantawid pamilya the alternative learning system also helped to ensure that even indigenous peoples and street children are not left behind and yet there are still some who ask where are the results of pantawid pamilya our answer oh come on they seem to think that pantawid pamilya is like a magic tablet that once taken by a child in kindergarten turns that child into a college graduate after only a few hours  perhaps they did not have enough time to study during their time let us help them count k to  lasts  years while my term only lasts for six now we see whos trying to deceive us there are even some who had the guts to raise an outcry and shout there are leakages in pantawid pamilya then we discovered they used data from  just to have something to criticize let me remind them i became president halfway through  perhaps you should be asking another president to explain the alleged leakage  i guarantee that when the time comes that the beneficiaries of this program are contributing to the economy those who are criticizing it today will be falling over themselves to proclaim that they are the father or mother of the expanded pantawid pamilya now in the sector of education we are making sure that the deficits of the past are erased and the needs of the present are addressed even as we prepare for the future in just our first two years in office we were able to close the backlogs we inherited of  million textbooks and  million school chairs in  the backlog of  classrooms was finally eliminated and the backlog of  teachers was likewise addressed with the help of our lgu partners  according to the estimates of deped from  up to  the total amount of new students  million this is because of the increase of enrollees and the implementation of the k to  program in order to meet this vast increase we need to add an estimated  classrooms to what we already have  of these have already been constructed this year we are slated to construct more than  more funds for the remaining  classrooms have already been included in the proposed  budget that we will pass tomorrow which we hope you will approve  the number of teachers we will need are estimated at  in  we have already hired  this year the total number of teachers we target to hire  the remaining  positions will be covered in the proposed  budget which we hope you will approve as well  according to bro armin the sum total of the classrooms our administration has constructed and the teachers we have hired exceeds the cumulative total of classrooms built and teachers hired in

according to studies  percent of graduates were able to find employment right away compared to the  percent recorded before there are even some industries breaking records for example the employment rate for the entire semiconductors and electronics industry has already reached  percent—just a little more and well be at  percent  secretary joel villanueva told us before of an ofw forced to return

their program i was able to have the opportunity to show my ability to run my own business  now on the sector of health to many filipinos falling ill poses a serious challenge to the fulfillment of their dreams families climbing the ladder of progress return back to zero once they are struck by illness not only are their savings emptied they also fall deep into debt when we came into office only  million filipinos were beneficiaries of philhealth we have almost doubled this number just this past june philhealth coverage has reached  million filipinos  the transformation we wrought before during elections new philhealth beneficiaries seemed to sprout like mushrooms instead of the basis for membership being the interest of filipinos it became manipulated to serve the electoral candidates interest now we have corrected that system there is more good news in the sector of health in  we announced if your family is part of the lowest quintile or the poorest  percent of our population and you are seeking treatment in public hospitals then we guarantee that you will not have to pay a single centavo beginning in  this has expanded to cover the next quintile of our society this means that for the poorest  percent of the population treatment in public hospitals is free this is the care that some have called inefficient and uncaring the only thing i have to say to them as aiza seguerra said back in the day i thank you bow  now let us hear some of the results of the improved philhealth program translated transcript of testimonial of danilo espiritu philhealth beneficiary i was diagnosed with quadruple clogs in the coronary area we didnt know how we could afford the operation the first hospital we went to said the operation would cost  pesos at  it would cost  pesos at ust hospital they said it was  pesos but when one of the doctors learned that my wife was covered by philhealth he said our case qualified under the zpackage and we could push through with the operation we just stood up then and went to fix the paperwork and i was provided the opportunity to extend my life the service i got at the hospital was comparable to that received by a private hospital patient i wasnt considered a charity case i was a fullfledged paying patient and philhealth paid for my operation to be honest i didnt pay for anything the little money that we did save we were able to use for the postoperation expenses im thankful for philhealth and our government for implementing these kinds of projects which genuinely help people in need  translated transcript of testimonial of governor lilia pineda sin tax should have been implemented earlier its the answer to our goal of providing universal healthcare it was a big help to the province of pampanga in the past the capitol spent over  million pesos a year in health aid but when the sin tax law was implemented those who needed healthcare were covered by philhealth we are truly grateful to president aquino because the project provided a huge relief for pampanga the money saved was used to fund other important projects the proceeds of the sin tax also went towards the construction of a birthing station hospital renovations and the construction of health centers were so thankful to the president for caring for the poor who suffer sickness  let us again return to the story of the past five years we went after the corrupt and we cleaned the systems which redounded to confidence in our markets businesses came into the country opportunities expanded all while we empowered filipinos to gain decent employment they patronized these businesses which having recognized that the playing field is level know they can profit without having to resort to illegal activities they then expand their operations and employ even more people this is a cycle justice trust economic growth the creation of opportunities progress boss this is the very spirit of where there is no corruption there is no poverty  and we did not just achieve change the transformation we are experiencing today has already exceeded the expectations we had in the beginning the cadastral survey which was started in  has been completed by us it took almost a century for those who came before us to complete  percent of this survey the more than half left to be done we finished in just five years in government this cadastral survey identifies the boundaries of the land covered by each city municipality and province in the philippines in armm for example it was as if the land gave birth to more land according to the maps there are only  million hectares belonging to the region but if we were to add up all the lands being claimed they would reach a total of  million hectares now because we have fixed the land record system through the cadastral survey no new land will be birthed in armm in  we conducted an inventory of sitios and we identified those that were still without electricity through the sitio electrification program we were able to bring light to  communities identified through this inventory on top of this because of the use of solar energy and other technology even farflung and isolated areas that would be difficult to connect to the grid already have electricity now around  percent of sitios in the philippines have already been energized the doe has guaranteed that before we step down from office all the rest of the sitios from the  tally will have electricity  now let us watch a farmer who has benefited from our sitio electrification program translated transcript

aviation there has also been a steady stream of good news in  the international civil aviation organization lifted the significant safety concerns it had imposed on our country back in  in the same year the european union allowed our flag carrier to resume its flights to europe the following year saw another local carrier receiving approval from the european union while the us federal aviation administration upgraded us to category  from the category  downgrade we had received in  because of these developments incoming and outgoing flights are increasing and it is also becoming easier for tourists to fly around the philippines even better news just this june the eu air safety committee removed its ban on all our air carriers—the first time that it has lifted its ban on the entire civil aviation sector of a country now all our airlines will be able to fly directly to the united kingdom italy and other countries part of the eu in seafaring in  the european maritime safety agency or emsa was already questioning our compliance to the standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers because of this there was a threat that the eu would no longer recognize our maritime education certificates if we did not act there would have been the chance that an estimated  filipino seafarers working on european boats would be out of jobs marina and the dotc went to work quickly in order to match our maritime education certificates to global standards to this day the eu continues to recognize our certifications come emsas next audit which will begin in october marina guarantees we will definitely pass  to sec jun abaya may you not waver in your resolve even when it seems that some have forgotten all that you have done for our sailors icaos lifting of the significant safety concerns it had imposed on our sector the european unions lifting of the ban on our airplanes and the federal aviation  upgrading us to category  it was also you who banned boats from setting out to see during typhoons which helped to keep passengers away from danger it is now rare for us to receive news about ships sinking during typhoons all of these achievements have seemingly been cast aside because of the complicated challenges in the public transport sector the biggest example of this is the mrt few mention that we have partners from the private sector in this endeavor who remember their entitlements but seem to have forgotten their obligations this partner of ours is supposed to be in charge of maintenance in  there should have been a general overhaul of the mrt but upon dotcs inspection only token cosmetic changes were undertaken this lack of care practically guaranteed the breakdown of our trains is it not in the interest of all companies to make sure that they get their moneys worth from their investment yet they allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point where at very short notice they just passed the job of improving the mrt onto us when we made moves to undertake improvements suddenly they wanted to take back the responsibility of maintenance however their proposal was significantly more expensive than hours this would of course translate to added expense and aggravation for our people we did not agree to this and began the process of obtaining new train coaches but because the mrtc was adamant they were able to obtain a tro on the procurement that is why the mrt situation has come to this sec jun you i and the entire population of metro manila are not pleased with what is happening the private sector relegated its\\xa0responsibility to us when we made moves to provide a solution they blocked us it is clear that our agenda and that of the mrtc will never meet now we are taking steps to buy out the corporation once this is fixed the state will be the sole decisionmaker while we are undertaking this process we are already implementing immediate maintenance work bigger more longterm solutions are also set to arrive next month we can expect the delivery of the prototype for new coaches once this passes scrutiny beginning in january three coaches will be delivered every month until our order of  coaches has been completed the process to obtain new rails is underway together with the upgrading of the signaling and automatic fare collecting systems all this we expect to be completed before we step down from office the power supply of our trains will be upgraded before the end of  there are  escalators that will be fixed before the end of the year while the procurement for the rehabilitation of  more escalators and  elevators is ongoing let me remind everyone when it comes to these matters we cannot take shortcuts in the processes we do not want our measures to be hampered by lawsuits left and right there are some who say that i wear blinders when it comes to those who have long been my companions on the straight path me i see the good things but i also see the bad am i the one with blinders or is it those who insist on seeing only the bad things on our armed forces back in november  tensions arose once more between north and south korea there were fears that war would break out in the peninsula we needed a plan to evacuate the  filipinos in south korea as well as the eight filipinos in north korea when i asked the afp about the assets we could use in an evacuation they said that the air force has a lone  the shortest duration for a round trip  hours the capacity around  people i made some calculations we needed to move  filipinos away from conflict which meant that under the most ideal conditions we would need  round trips which would take  hours each this is equivalent to  days of travel no one can count on an old  to cope with such heavy usage if we deployed ships each could carry  people at a time but we would be lucky if each round trip could be completed within  days should further conflict break out there was the chance that the entire situation would have been over by the time we evacuated of our people we took immediate action to address these limitations now from one functional  we now have three at our disposal and we are planning to acquire two more there are others to accompany them the first of three  medium lift transports has arrived with the other two arriving within the year we also expect the delivery of two more light lift transports before the end of   if we ever encounter another spate of problems like what happened in  we are going to need more assets when yolanda struck our docks were destroyed and our ability to deliver aid was hampered in such situations landing craft utilities are invaluable because of their ability to dock on any shore now we have increased the number of our landing craft utilities from four to ten there is the brp tagbanua by next week two landing craft heavy will arrive from australia the turnover of these vessels was very generous they even came with spare parts and generators we plan on buying three more once all the paperwork has been put in order the processes to procure them will begin these vessels will reduce our dependence on the kindness of other nations we will be able to accelerate delivery to different parts of the philippines and more promptly send aid supplies and other heavy equipment such as bulldozers which are needed for clearing and relief operations  to better watch over our territory we have also acquired   fighters to replace our  fighter jets that were retired in  the first two units will arrive in december and the rest of the deliveries will be completed by  we have also acquired war ships such as the brp gregorio del pilar and the ramon alcaraz seven of   helicopters six of eight  helicopters  troop carrier trucks and  assault rifles our target is to obtain two more frigates six close air support aircrafts  armored personnel carriers and other new items such as  units of force protection equipment  grenade launchers and an additional  assault rifles  in total we have completed  projects for modernization and i have approved  more compare this to the  projects completed by the three administrations that came before us combined let us listen to one of our servicemen from the air force translated transcript of testimonial of jun perry member of the philippine air force for the record sir our air force now

       "  't boosts morale ive heard confirmation from our army classmates themselves one of them even said mistah when i heard the sound of the chopper taking flight i was so inspired this is a dream that has slowly but surely turned into a reality  as for our police for the first time in our history each of our policemen has his or her own firearm furthermore to improve the capacity of our police force to shoot scoot and communicate we have distributed  patrol jeeps which are only part of the  that we have procured we have also distributed  of  new utility vehicles as well as  handheld radios we are likewise procuring  long firearms  investigative kits and another  radios let us listen to some of our policemen who talk about how these efforts have helped them in their work translated transcript of testimonial of melvin velasquez when i entered the police service in  i was issued a  revolver sometimes some of the criminals we encountered were equipped with highpowered weapons the  revolver paled in comparison to the ones used by criminals in fact i had to buy my own gun it is difficult for us law enforcers when we encounter situations where we really have to risk our lives it was a big change when all policemen were finally given their own guns we know that we can depend on the firearms issued by the government to us those of us in the service dream of owning our own house and lot it was only during this administration that such a dream was realized as a lowranking law enforcer i really feel the reforms instituted by our president—one of which is the value accorded to the national police the only way we can possibly repay all these good things is by fulfilling our duties in the correct and right way—even if it means sacrificing my life  our drive to improve our police forces equipment is complemented by our work smarter strategy this has been brought to life by oplan lambatsibat whose pilot program was implemented in metro manila we studied how criminals operate and strategically deployed our policemen this is how we have caught the big fish gang leaders dismantled syndicates and lowered crime rates across the nation during our term almost  people on the wanted list have been apprehended by the pnp more than  gangs have been neutralized and  unlicensed guns have been confiscated in the country in ncr from january to june of  there was an average of  cases of murder and homicide every week thanks to oplan lambatsibat this has gone down to  cases per week as of june  in terms of robberies thefts and carnapping incidents in the same period the weekly average in ncr has gone down to  from  just last week dexter balane the leader of the robbery and holdup group in cahoots with the martilyo gang was apprehended by our police force also in the apprehended list are the notorious tiamzon couple commander parago and other cadres of the cppnpandf such as ruben saluta and emmanuel bacarra there is also the elusive jovito palparan as well as the leaders of the biff namely basit usman mohammad ali tambako abdulgani esmael pagao and the international terrorist marwan  it is clear for all to see the state nurtures its men and women in uniform and they are abundantly reaping this care together with new equipment we have also increased the combat pay of our soldiers as well as the subsistence allowance of the entire uniformed services we have put up more than  housing units for our men and women in uniform and this number will reach  before i step down from office  in our camps we also have livelihood programs and among those benefiting from these are the soldiers who have been wounded or disabled in the course of fulfilling their duty to heighten our focus on them i have already ordered our afp to work together with our cabinet and implement initiatives that will ensure that those who have sacrificed for the nation will have decent livelihoods  let us now talk about infrastructure i remember when i was a congressman in tarlac during summer the tarlac river was like a desert during the rainy season the river would surge and overflow with the macarthur highway among the areas affected by flooding i asked who is in charge of flood control in our district we approached the pampanga river delta project they said that the lower agno project had jurisdiction over us then when we went to them they told us to go back to pampanga instead of helping us they chose to point fingers at each other the time of skirting responsibility has ended on the straight path longawaited infrastructure projects are constructed one after the other i have already mentioned some of them there is the lullutan bridge in isabela which our countrymen in the province had anticipated for two decades like rodito albano it is now open  the jalaur river multipurpose project in iloilo was conceptualized around the time of my birth we have recently broken ground for stage  of this project  the balogbalog multipurpose project phase  in tarlac was planned in the  it has now been approved and the bidding process has already started construction of the basilan circumferential road started in back in   but was longdelayed because of conflict in the province hostile elements have blocked its completion because as soon as it is constructed they will have a more difficult time escaping the law the delivery of services to the area would also be expedited thus weakening their influence on the locals the vast majority of the road is now passable and only three bridges are still being finished  i have already mentioned the muntinlupacavite expressway which opened last friday the first two stages of the tarlacpangasinanla union expressway or tplex are also open it is the same for the phase  of the star toll when the cavitelaguna expressway project the  phase  the metro manila skyway stage  and the nlexslex connector road are completed—all the more will the benefits of our infrastructure strategy reach even more people  to address flooding we have the ongoing repairs and maintenance of our flood control projects among these is the pasigmarikina river channel improvement project phase  which was completed in  the highimpact flood control projects for the ncr and its surrounding areas are slated for completion in november and our target is to complete the blumentritt interceptor catchment area by next year the laguna lakeshore expressway dike project meanwhile will be awarded this december i am sure that everyone can see it does not matter if local officials belong to our party or if we won in these provinces the only question we ask is there a need for this project let us listen to some of those we have helped translated transcript of testimonial of governor elias bulut when the president first ran for senator he lost in our province when he ran for president he lost again in spite of that the president still helped our province  we are witness to his style of governance the administration recognizes the problems of the region and responds based on need rather than considering the votes they earned here our province used to be neglected—because of the meager funds given to us by previous administrations people here had to walk for about two days to get to their destination with the construction of this new road so many opportunities are going to open up for the people of apayao  agriculture here is booming and the people finally feel that there actually is a government that looks after them to the president we hope you can come over so you can see what youve done here what used to be far is so much nearer now because of the good roads youve built  translated transcript of testimonial of rep mercedes alvarez when i met the president in bacolod city i thanked him because our road was already finished he said dont thank me thank our bosses and of course he told me not to lie down on the road again  what happened before this was that i was on my way up to candoni and i saw the road that the dpwh had worked on was finally completed i was so happy that i decided to take a picture right there travel time has been cut in half thanks to the new national road candoni used to be a very isolated area investors didnt want to make their way there because of the state of the roads but now the roads are good public transport ply these routes students now dont have to walk all the way to school because now they can commute when you plant sugarcane you have to bring it all the way to the central market but now with our new roads planting will be easier more economical and cheaper mr president on behalf of the people in cauayan hinobaan ilog candoni kabankalan and sipalay in the province of negros occidental we want to thank you for your commitment your projects and your programs mabuhay po kayo  to governor bulut in the senatorial election of  i was only  in the hearts of the people in your province and i was only  \\xa0during the presidential elections but given all the infrastructure we have built i do not think anyone can say that you arent in the hearts of the filipino people you yourselves have witnessed that when it comes to projects

on the road i will have you arrested  the violation obstruct',\n",
       "  'ion of traffic our strategy is clear in constructing roads bridges and other infrastructure we reduce the suffering where we must and we accelerate the delivery of benefits i only ask that we all contribute in the effort and that we be willing to make sacrifices for example to address flooding in manila we pushed for the construction of a catchment area which was protested by a particular university they said that some of their old buildings could be affected by the project another example there is already a need to retrofit the guadalupe bridge because it is vulnerable to earthquakes but can we close down this bridge without completely shutting down edsa this bridge cannot be fixed through conventional means we need to open up an alternative path one proposal estimates that  vehicles would be able to pass through the route thus if we can get this done we can retrofit guadalupe the problem is that the chosen path for the route has been protested by a number of groups they agree that guadalupe has to be retrofit and they also agree with our plan to address heavy traffic along edsa but they do not want to be inconvenienced by the structures we need to construct such an attitude delays the construction of much needed infrastructure there have also been times when assistance was not only denied roadblocks were also put in our path by officials on the local level for example there was an area devastated by a calamity we went there as soon as possible i was greeted by the congressman and the mayor but it was the city administrator and vice mayor who spoke with me we told them the dpwh has the necessary equipment and we are ready to put up temporary shelters all we need is land on which to construct them their answer there are  hectares that can be used unfortunately when i returned not a single bit of land was turned over to us because they said they were using them for something else that is just one horror story for our part we are here to help we will do everything in our power to give as much assistance as we can in accordance with the law if they do not want to cooperate the only thing i will say is this next year is an election year and our bosses will be the ones to decide who has alleviated or added to their suffering  let us now move on to the area of publicprivate partnerships if we add together all the solicited ppp projects of the past three administrations the grand total six projects under our watch the number of solicited ppp project  of this number  have been awarded  are being bidded out while  are still in the pipeline you can judge the difference for yourselves back then no one would join these projects now private companies are competing with one another and are even paying us premiums the premiums we have received from our private sector partners in the ppp have reached  billion which goes directly to our national coffers  each successful project redounds to even greater confidence in the philippines which will in itself help accelerate the process of putting up the rest of the infrastructure we need the suffering of our people will be lessened and may even come to an end as for infrastructure about to be constructed my sole request is for all of us to calm down the procurement process is long in fact four months to complete the process is already considered fast you could be considered lucky if the computer you ordered is delivered within that time just imagine the process when it comes to the construction of bridges for my part it doesnt matter if i am unable to preside over the groundbreaking or ribboncutting what is important is that these projects are wellplanned and legal so that when they are approved construction can proceed quickly the quality of the structure will withstand anyones scrutiny the cabinet already knows this when we have cabinet or neda board meetings i have sometimes joked that attendees should bring their own blankets because the meetings will likely go on until late evening this happens because i examine each detail carefully so that when we present these projects to our bosses they will also say we approve of this because the process has been transparent and were sure that these projects will benefit us without doubt the transformation we are feeling is vast whereas before the capacity of filipinos to hope was wavering now according to the latest social weather station survey eight out of ten filipinos believe that the philippines can be—if not already is—a developed nation  there is also a survey from gallup inc which has been in business for  years now and is considered the oldest and one of the most respected polling agencies in the world they asked the citizens of  countries would you say that now is a good time or a bad time to find a job the result the philippines ranked number one in terms of job optimism for the asiapacific region and number two in the entire world  indeed our countrymen are confident in the stability of their future even newly hired employees today can make regular payments on cars or condominium units given this it should not come as a surprise that just last year car sales in the philippines grew by  percent the belief now we can afford to pay not only the down payment but also the monthly amortizations as well with so many of our countrymen able to purchase cars two major automobile companies in the country now take two and half to three months to deliver cars to buyers in my own experience the first time i was employed i computed how long it would take for me to buy my own car the result of my calculations it would take me  years and thats for a secondhand vehicle i was also given the chance to speak with the leaders of two big foreign companies one already has a factory here while the other intends to enter our market both of them expressed a strong interest in setting up research and development facilities in the philippines they recognize the potential and talent of the filipino which they believe can help them maintain their edge in their respective industries they asked us can you supply us with the hundreds of employees with masters and doctoral degrees in engineering that we need the dosts response of course i even said if companies would start hiring for hightech industries here perhaps our countrymen would come home and accept lower pay so that they could be with their loved ones their answer theres no need to lower the salaries we will match whatever they are earning abroad  even when it comes to our fisheries sector the way the world views us has changed completely just this april the european commission lifted the yellow card warning it had imposed on the philippines in the past there were some problems with the documentation and tracking of caught fish for this reason the commission could not ascertain whether the fish were caught legally our administration immediately worked to prevent the philippines from being included in the eus blacklist and thus avoided any ban on our exports i later learned that when secretary procy alcala was in belgium  he was told that the philippines should not resent the attention if other nations with yellow card status approached us after all we are the ones in a position to teach them the initiatives and steps to resolve the problem  i also remember how in the beginning i felt that leaders of some countries only spoke to us because they were obligated to do so some even seemed to be scolding us when i first interacted with them now we receive invitations for state visits one after the other with all these leaders offering praises some leaders even go so far as to propose that we could arrive in the morning and that they wouldnt take it against us if we leave at noon so long as we make the visit once i was even surprised to receive this question from the leader of a progressive country what is your secret of course since bragging isnt in our nature my response was our secret is that we followed your good example there are also instances when we and members of our delegation were asked its really exciting in the philippines now is your term truly limited to six years cant anything be done to fix this every time our answer is we once had a president who did everything he could to stay in power we need to make sure that the doors that would lead to such a situation will never be reopened  of course even if there is evidence of concrete transformation left and right there are still those who oppose the straight path they say we work slowly they say that when they become president without a doubt our lives will improve those who are of an advanced age will probably answer this with a raised eyebrow and an oh really the younger generation will simply say yeah right  we ask how will they do this they say well take care of it we ask where are the details and concrete plans how will they fulfill these promises again well take care of it its like they think they can pass off these kinds of vague answers as solutions to the problems we face unfortunately no medicine has yet been invented to help those who play deaf and blind  my advice at times when our intelligence as a people is clearly being insulted we should just change the channel we might benefit more from watching a sitcom now i wish to talk about legislation which i hope will be passed

among the victims of those massacred by the soldiers that is what hurts the most this is why we are here today we joined the moro islamic liberation front to fight for our rights hassan when i joined the milf our principles were premised upon nasshur awisshahada for example under president estradas administration the people of mindanao were under the threat of annihilation of course any muslim would think to defend those principles if you are a muslim you are part of the bangsamoro you were therefore viewed as a terrorist and would not be given any work—because you might end up destroying the company the sajahatra has now arrived we were more encouraged by this we learned and applied what we learned for me this may be the path for our brothers and sisters in the bangsamoro to lead peaceful lives and have the wherewithal to lift themselves out of poverty since  i have never experienced a peaceful bangsamoro but today if the agreement is fulfilled with allahs blessing we might finally be able to live in peace  i also wish to put forward the bill on the rationalization of fiscal incentives once enacted into law this will correct the many loopholes in the provisions of our incentives and will rationalize taxation for our businesses we also ask for the urgent passage of the unified uniformed personnel pension reform bill so that we can finally set up a sustainable and just pension system for our uniformed services i cannot stress just how important the passage of this law is at present we already need trillions of pesos to fund the pensions of our servicemen we need the authorization from congress to address this very complicated situation tomorrow you will receive the proposed budget for  we have never failed to pass the national budget on time thus it is my hope that we will continue this correct practice especially that we are now in the final stretch of the administration  also might i share there used to be a time when i was against depriving a person the right to run for office just because he had a famous family name why would we pass legislation to stop a person who really wants to be a public servant but i have realized there is something inherently wrong in giving a corrupt family or individual the chance at an indefinite monopoly of public office it is exactly for that reason that when someone suggested that i stay on as president even just for three more years i myself argued against it if i agreed to this suggestion i would open the door for such a practice to be repeated in the future and we cannot be certain if the person who will succeed me will possess sincere intentions—he may instead choose to lord it over our people to pursue his personal interest i believe it is now time to pass an antidynasty law  it is because of this congress that laws that now stand as the solid foundations of transformation were passed to those in the house of representatives and the senate especially to your members who have been our partners on the straight path for all these years thank you for the philippine competition law for the act allowing the full entry of foreign banks  and for the amendments to the cabotage law thank you for the sin tax reform act thank you for the responsible parenthood act  thank you for all the other meaningful laws that you passed indeed so much is achieved when we have a congress that is determined to usher in real progress  a while ago i thought it best to speak about where we came from in order to give sufficient context for the challenges that we faced continue to face and will still face and also for the criticism hurled at us all of this censure ridicule and abuse i accepted as part and parcel of the opportunity to serve you the truth is i did not have to go through this

livelihood programs—our government poured and continues to pour all it can to help affected areas  yet there are also things left to be done there are still communities living in danger zones that must be relocated away from threats to their safety as regards rebuilding there is a need to strengthen coordination between the local and national levels in order to ensure that we finish projects at the soonest possible time when it comes to foreign affairs we did and continue to do everything in our power to be a responsible member of the community of nations with each measure we take we ask only for what is just and according to the rule of law instead of a solution participated in by just a few we have advocated that all contribute to the solution of a problem that involves us all as you know we are facing a challenge in the west philippine sea we are up against a nation that is far ahead of us whether in terms of influence the economy or military force yet when it comes to reason and love for country we do not fall behind as with all other problems our unity is the key through which we can uphold our rights to my bosses in all truth given the challenges that we faced we could have just put forward bandaid solutions we could have just handed over a bag of relief goods or crowded ourselves into photo opportunities but we all know that in the philippines we have a special anger for creditmongers what will we do with popularity points if we will just leave problems to succeeding generations at every opportunity we sought to identify the correct root of the problem and implemented a clear and longterm solution to this some challenges faced by our country we have overcome as for the rest we have begun taking steps towards a permanent solution that is the biggest difference once there was only hopelessness now people rely on the government in fact they expect anticipate and in many cases want the government to resolve the problems our nation faces in the soonest possible time looking back with the sheer volume of wrongs we had to correct we did not just start from zero we started from the negative—negative in terms of resources to pursue change negative in terms of opportunities negative in terms of hope we filled the gaps we brought about positive change and now our achievements have far surpassed our expectations let us listen to our countrymen who will testify to this transformation translated transcript in the  years that i have worked at pagasa i have seen how much of our facilities have improved under the term of our president before pagasa worked blind now because of the radars and additional observation stations that we have our capacities to predict the weather have improved pagasa is a changed agency before if you said you worked at pagasa you were shunned—perhaps because of the quality of the agencys work but now because of all the new equipment our forecasts are very accurate today if youre from pagasa youre considered a big shot   translated transcript of testimonial of congresswoman kaka bagao back then you could not trust politicians they promised so much but could not deliver on any of their commitments the leadership brand of president aquino treats everyone fairly everyone is important services are delivered even to the farthest corners of the country such as in the dinagat islands change is so evident for instance in the small towns which used to be without power there are now generators there are also new roads we believe so much in this government if the president were not our leader today if we did not have an honorable representative in congress we wouldnt know what our situation would be we are thankful for this brand of good leadership that has served as an inspiration for other public servants now when we say government service it is service that is seen felt and provides an inspiration for people to hope and dream for further success i now believe my aspirations can be realized that my dreams are important and nothing is irrelevant  to our bosses if the transformation of our society isnt interrupted it would indeed be reasonable to say all we have achieved is only a taste of what is to come as we have said before you aint seen nothing yet  i already mentioned a while ago the sws survey that was not widely covered in the news that  out of  filipinos believed that the philippines will become—if not already is—a developed country in the foreseeable future this is the opinion of our countrymen but our economists in neda themselves are studying this in a scientific manner and they have reached the same conclusion let us take a look from  to  we posted an average gdp growth of  percent this is the fastest period of economic growth in the past  years  if we reach  percent this  then we will have posted the fastest  year average growth period in almost six decades  of course the growth of our economy means a corresponding growth in governments ability to care for and empower the citizenry to make the most of opportunities being created in the country it is clear if we are not derailed—if we continue along the straight path—then we will reach first world status within one generation if the reforms that have led to our dynamic economic growth continue then it wont be long before we can stand on equal footing with if not surpass the very countries we admire  did we even think this was possible back in the beginning on the other hand if we return to the crooked path we will be condemned to waiting for nothing we will once again be left behind and the upward trajectory of our economy will reach a premature end we have indeed planted impressive reform and we have already nourished it\\xa0with intense effort and sacrifice who in their right mind would decide to cut the tree down on a whim when we have only begun harvesting its fruits there is a sentiment that i want to share with you it is best captured in the question will we lose all that we have built—all that we have worked hard for—in one election  from this perspective the next election will be a referendum for the straight and righteous path you will decide whether the transformation we are experiencing today will be permanent or simply a brief and lucky deviation from a long history of failure the question are we treading the right path if your answer is no then that is akin to saying i liked it better before lets just go back to the crooked path in such a scenario i will respect your wishes and remain silent but if your answer is yes then as always i am ready to continue supporting you even after i step down from office until my last breath you can count on me to stand with you the same way you have stood by me i will walk alongside you and with arms linked we can continue bringing to life the ideals of the straight and righteous path  my bosses i will admit i am not perfect there were times when i was let down by people whom i believed knew how to do their jobs during moments when those sowing doubt seemed to succeed perhaps we were unable to share the needed information in a timely and appropriate manner in these matters i ask for your understanding nevertheless i can look anyone in the eye and say i made the best decisions based on the information and the capacities we possessed at the time my one and only interest is the wellbeing of my bosses i did all i could to forge a nation that is more just and more progressive—one that enjoys the fruits of meaningful change  i will let history decide as i did during my mothers wake i will once again speak the words from  timothy chapter  verse  and i quote i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith  my bosses we began with our country seemingly engulfed in darkness we were uncertain whether there was even a light at the end of the tunnel now we are being greeted by the dawn of justice and opportunity you have all seen the heights we have reached you have heard the stories of our fellow filipinos—stories that prove what we can achieve with our own strength with the help of our countrymen and with the spirit of cooperation towards the fulfillment of our collective desires now we can hold our heads up high and say to the entire world i can the filipino can this is only the beginning  yes this is only the beginning this is only the beginning of a country that will not be cowed and instead will stand as a beacon of justice and resolve in the global community this is only the beginning of prosperity brought about by freedom from corruption this is only the beginning of a society where every filipino who works hard and does the right thing is guaranteed to succeed this is only the beginning and now history poses a challenge to us to continue the transformation so that it may bring about even more opportunities for future generations this is only the beginning  we are only in the first

dwelling on the sins of the past or blaming those who are perceived to be responsible for the mess that we are in and suffering from except maybe to extract a lesson or two from its errors we will not tarry because it is the present that we are concerned with and the future that we should be prepared for lest i be misunderstood let me say clearly that those who betrayed the peoples trust shall not go unpunished and they will have their day in court and if the evidence warrants they will have their day of reckoning too when i decided to seek the presidency of this republic i knew what the ills of our country were i knew their causes and i was briefed on those who caused the causes i heard the people on the streets complain that justice had become illusory that equity and fairness and speedy disposition of cases had deteriorated into hollow concepts fit only for masteral dissertations it was and still is very sad indeed as a former prosecutor i know that there are ways of knowing how fast or how slow cases go what i did was to look into the number of postponements and the time difference between each postponement and the next setting it was simple as that i will appreciate deeply if we all in government attend to this urgent need i was determined then as i am now determined and better now positioned to wage war against those who make a mockery of our laws including those who make life for us all miserable i wish to assure everyone though that vindictiveness is not in my system just like you and i all equal treatment and equal protection are what i ask for our people but we must have the courage to fight for what we believe in undeterred by the fear of failing or losing indeed courage knows no limits cowardice does at this point there are concerns few i wish to convey to all to the end that as i perorate on facts figures plans programs and solutions these concerns will not dissipate or get lost along our way thus to our religious bishops leaders priests pastors

million  hundred thousand the number is quite staggering and scary the drug lords that you desperately want to strangle are not here walang mga bilyonaryo dito the ones that you catch running after are just the lieutenants they do it by technology theyre cooking it in the international waters tinatapon nila iyan bulto by the drums dikitan nila ng gps so makikita agad we are hard put sa intelligence because theyve invented this direct satellite hindi na magdadaan iyan ng all they have to do is to triangulate where the pagikot niyan and theres so many and theyre in coves if we do not help from our friends here in asia and america and europe the sheer number and problem believe me will drown us as a republic kayo tignan ninyo ito how i can i solve the problem now by arresting hinahanap ko matagal na akong presidente gusto kong patayin ang problema pupunta pa ako doon then ill ask the permission from this country that i will be on because i have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country ganoon iyon eh hindi lang kasi naintin—ayaw pa naman bitawan kasi ayaw naman kasi ng military pati police but you know i said ill be talking in front of the republic through its representatives for the people so i have to tell you how do we solve this problem tell me ako naman okay lang eh make it public fine make it confidential if you go to mayor go to you to your house okay but that is really the enormity of the problem its so enormous that you are intimidated even just to make a move because you know you cannot stop it anyway mabunggo mo isa dito hinulog sa dagat eh marami namang nagluluto doon its a free for all enterprise for the criminals at this time kung ako if i had just the plane and time i could ang sinasabi ko—sabi ko roon sa military pag nakita ninyo eh di pasabugin mo maski nag surrender iyan may white flag panggyera lang iyan hindi iyan pangkriminal pasabugin mo show no mercy to them because they are not doing any mercy to us anyway bakit ako mag iyan ang problema but we should not despair like someone wrote it is when the night is darkest that dawn breaks we are imbued with resiliency that has been tested and proven more difficult times as in the past we have to bond and act together we have to help each other for then and only then can we truly prevail and the filipino disciplined informed and involved shall rise from the rubbles of sorrow and pain so much so that all the mirrors in the world will reflect the face of a passion that have change this land daghang sal'],\n",
       " [' of rodrigo roa duterte session hall of the house of representatives \\xa0 kindly sit down thank you for your courtesy when i was a member of congress i — my seat was over there the seat the lady with a violent – — not violent but rather violet dress — seated but i was always absent together with the speaker and tonyboy floirendo who is still absent until today  and that started ay nandiyan ba sorry but his propensity started almost  years ago when we were members of the  congress senate president aquilino pimentel iii and the members of the senate pantaleon alvarez the speaker and the members of the house of representatives vice president maria leonor robredo former presidents fidel ramos joseph estrada and former president gloria arroyo chief justice maria lourdes sereno of the supreme court and the members of courts archbishop pinto and the distinguished guests of the diplomatic corps secretary salvador medialdea and the members of the cabinet my fellow workers in government my countrymen when i took my oath of office a year or so ago i knew that our country was reeling from a multitude of problems that day there was euphoria in the air resulting from a successful campaign and the thought that dominated my being was to make good on my promise to the people to bring  — change in government not a change that is passing but a change that can survive the test of time although i still had to know the magnitude and gravity of the problems my feeling then was that equipped with political will and braced by a concerned citizenry those problems would eventually be bested by us it was only a matter of determination and collective action it was only a question of time for as i saw it then as i see it now there is no problem in the world which can stop the march of a people with unflinching and tenacious determination that was how euphoric — euphoric it has been early on i felt that if change was to be meaningful it had to start with those occupying the highest positions in government because change that comes from below is more transitory than permanent and i was aiming for permanence let change trickle down from  bottom it has to be a change that is not confined merely to the replacement of people by people but a change in the peoples attitude disposition and work ethic sadly although we knew years ago that what was needed or ought to do we did not do  because our idea of government was parochial and we could not rise above family ethnic and clan loyalties as well as loyalty to friends and coworkers no one wanted to be a snitch that is why we are one in saying that genuine change is what this country truly needs i believed then as i believe still that progress and development will sputter if criminals illegal drugs illegal users of drugs are allowed to roam the streets freely victimizing seeming with impunity the innocent and the helpless worse yet there were times in the past when the protectors of the people were themselves the perpetrators of the very crimes they were tasked to prevent or suppress it is ironic as it is madness i have learned that economy surges only when there is peace and order prevailing in places where investors can pour  their capital and expertise i have learned from my experience in davao city that investor confidence  bolstered and fortified only if a potent force and mechanism for  protection of local and foreign investments are in place that is why i have resolved that no matter how long it takes the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering  that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in the fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting despite international and local pressures the fight will not stop  until those who deal in it understand that they have to cease they have to stop because the alternatives are either jail or hell  and i will make sure very sure that they will not have the luxury of enjoying the benefits of their greed and madness i do not intend to loosen the leash in the campaign or lose the fight against illegal drugs neither do i intend to preside over the destruction of the filipino youth by being timid and tentative in my decisions and actions  to the critics against this fight your efforts will be better spent if you use the influence moral authority and ascendancy of your organizations over your respective sectors to educate the people on the evils of illegal drugs instead of condemning the authorities and unjustly blaming for every killing that bloodies this country but dont get me wrong i value human life the way i value mine each life that is snuffed out translates into future generations lost it is like cracking the acorn from which an oak tree grows– which in turn produce the seeds to complete the cycle of  perpetuity there is a jungle out there there are beasts and vultures preying on the helpless the innocent  the unsuspecting i will not allow the ruin of the youth the disintegration of families and the retrogression of communities forced by criminals whose greed for money is as insatiable as it is devoid of moral purpose neither will i be immobilized into inaction by the fear that i will commit an act that will expose me to public condemnation or legal prosecution you harm the children in whose hands the future of this republic is entrusted and i will hound you to the very gates of hell  that is why i ask you to join me in this fight against illegal drugs and all forms of criminality the government equipped with legal authority and you with the moral ascendancy over the sector you represent can do so much and hopefully eradicate this social scourge that plagues us no end look beyond your biases your prejudices your ambition  your political agenda the search for change will begin and end only when we look into ourselves and find it within today a multitude of problems confront us no sooner is one problem solved  another surges forth in its place but we will not be disheartened we will not be cowed we will not be overwhelmed it is during trying times and troubled events that the resilience perseverance and determination of the people are tested the filipino is no stranger or neophyte to situations like the one we face today we can and we will overcome as we did countless times in the past  only if we work together towards a common goal sad to say despite all efforts peace especially in the island of mindanao continues to elude us but of course it is not the peace of the dead but the peace of the living that we seek peace flits away like a butterfly when you try to snatch it by the wings and our pursuit of peace continues the red insurgency has been with us for decades the muslim issue for centuries so much time has lapsed so many lives have been lost and ',\n",
       "  'so much destruction has been wrought but peace eludes us still sometimes i am almost tempted to conclude that peace might not be able to come during our lifetime but believe me it will not be for want of trying and i will persist in our goal of attaining peace  to the last day of this administration and maybe even beyond although in a different capacity  there is rebellion in mindanao the extremists have declared it their purpose to establish a caliphate within philippine territory along the teachings and beliefs of  islamic state of iraq and syria or otherwise known as isis the battle of marawi has dealt a terrible blow to our quest for peace especially now that an alien ideology and a radical shift in purpose have been injected into the local setting i declared martial law in mindanao because i believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties  at the same time the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to regroup in another place to fight another day but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of mindanao martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus enable the military to arrest detain and question suspected members and sympathizers of the rebellion similar to what happened to the parents of the maute brothers as president i am reiterating my unwavering support and commitment to the soldiers of our armed forces and the members of our police force —  those who are on the ground and in the battlefields and those who are risking their lives for our country and our democracy i have your backs to those who oppose and think that all these efforts are out of order i hold myself — me and me alone should be responsible  the people of marawi need help caught in the crossfire between government troops and muslim extremists they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward if we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few at the vanguard of our struggle for peace and order are our armed forces and police they are the silent heroes who risk their lives everyday for our countrys security in recognition of their valor we have crafted a program to provide them with comprehensive social assistance including financial should they meet harm in the performance of their duty for the family left behind by those who fell or are rendered totally disabled in the line of duty we shall provide shelter health care assistance education and employment that is my way of telling our troops never fear do your duty i stand behind you so does this government and all its agencies  to decisively address insurgency and terrorism we are working doubly hard towards  a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country we continue to strengthen the defense capability of the afp as a deterrence against terrorists lawless elements and other threats my fellow citizens what i have said so far about the events in marawi and its neighboring environs is only a part of a looming problem which will cut across all classes and all sectors of society and eventually affect the entire country from north to south from east to west given the fact that mindanao supplies a great part of our countrys food requirements i refer to climate change which could bring drought and long dry spells affecting food production in mindanao given the fact that mindanao is unusually warming i ask all agencies involved in food production to look into this and act accordingly also i am appealing to all our legislators to immediately pass the national land use act or nalua  to ensure the rational and sustainable use of our land and our physical resources given the competing needs of food security housing businesses and environmental conservation ours is a rich country wealth that this country is endowed with  a gift from god to be utilized for the  welfare and the common good i do not believe that this gift was given to us to be merely viewed or appreciated but to be extracted from the earth and utilized to make life worth living that is why i say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth what is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes that way it will not only be the few who are the rich but also the poor who are many who will benefit therefrom therefore i call on our industrialists investors  commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the philippines to process our raw materials into finished products  at this point in my administration if possible we shall put a stop to the extraction and exportation of our mineral resources to foreign nations  for processing abroad and importing them back to the philippines in the form of consumer goods at prices twice or thrice the value of the original raw materials foreign corporations pay for them however in the extraction and utilization of these resources extreme care must be exercised  that we do not recklessly and needlessly harm the environment  responsible regulated and sustainable development is what we advocate and require the protection of the environment must be made a priority ahead of mining and all other activities that adversely affect one way or another and this policy is nonnegotiable i sternly warn i am warning all mining operations and contractors to refrain from the unbridled and irresponsible destruction of our watersheds forests and aquatic resources you have gained much from mining we only get about  billion a year but you have considerably neglected your responsibility to protect and preserve — and even the tax its about five percent — environment for posterity i am holding all mining companies and its officials responsible for the full and quick cleanup restoration  rehabilitation of all areas damaged by mining activities and the extension of all necessary support to the communities that have suffered minings disastrous effects on their health  livelihood and environment among others ganito ̳yan eh medyo alis muna ako diyan sa sasakit ang mata ko diyan sa y na ̳yan  alam mo you have the mining i have to grant you a mining because you have complied with all the requirements of the law and i cannot id be subject to a mandamus if everything is perfect and you have every right to mine but in doing so you destroy the rivers you destroy the streams from which the poor people fish — halwan or mudfish — and that is protein for the day for them ngayon makita mo naman not only gina lopez gave you a clear picture of what was happening horrendously n',\n",

taxes makuha ko talagang ibubuhos ko ngayon if you can make an arrangement an inventory of the — ̳yung nasira — ̳yung mga tao nagutom pati ̳yung river nila wala nang makuha because you know guys

hambog lang kayo diyan punta tayo doon sa diwalwal doon sa  and i will show you the river up there at the source its so pristine but doon sa — right at the start of the boundary where the millings are started the water there is not clear it is not brown it is black your one peso will win one million from me if i am lying kung gusto mo isama ko kayo bukas doon ngayon ̳pag tinarget tayo ng mga g npa na ̳yan eh problema natin ̳yan lahat sabaysabay na lang tayo bakante ang presidency bakante ang senado pati ang congressman pero totoo ̳yan you should visit the even the first spade even the first spade full of earth that you extract and throw it away of no use itabi mo lang ̳yan diyan eh because its an open pit you dig and dig and dig is already the first spade there is the decreasing of mother earth alam mo ang isa pang galit sa mining si speaker he comes from a mining town but he hates mining ako naman kasi mga kaibigan ko ̳yung iba ̳yung mga classmate ko mga vice president ng mining magpunta sila dito but it reduces into something — the damage that you have caused its not about our friendship its not about years of being in the same room its not about being fraternity brothers but it is something that  ganun ̳yan eh alam mo ̳yung martial law i am not so much endeavored diyan sabihin ninyo na hindi ninyo ibigay okay lang wala akong problema diyan maski sabihin ninyo na tama na okay lang then i will still fight the way i will fight the war if it is not acceptable to the normal of civilian conduct then i am sorry because i am not fighting a civilian war i am stopping violence and rebellion hindi talaga ako ibigay man ninyo o hindi para sa akin wala because ako i do not intend to go beyond my term as a matter of fact mas gusto kong barilin ako doon sa

apat lima lokohin ninyo ako bat tayo pa ba ang maglokohan just because this is congress it has to be a secret secret maniwala kayong mga ito pareho kaming lahat niyan ayaw pa tumawa kunwari  so i will increase the taxes then i will think of something that will compensate or make up for the damage or at least the income restored otherwise ill have to stop mining i will ask you to stop it its not good we are a small group of islands hindi naman marami the coastal marami̳yan kasi marami paikotikot but we are in a contiguous territory maliit lang tayo you must remember that there are so many billions of the future generations waiting in this stratosphere ang gusto ninyo para hindi na kayo mandamay huminto na kayo ng ano then let us go to because this will not end here how about the billions and billions and billions offilipinos who will come after us kawawa naman theyll have to scratch mother earth to eat bythis time kung walang upheaval no regeneration will occur we are almost

pangalawang asawa ̳yung isa ganun rin ̳di ba ̳di ba sir suntukin kita diyan ngayon liar ka finally let me make this appeal to those directly engaged in mining declare your correct income  pay your correct taxes believe me your failure to do so will be your undoing and eventual ruin  hindi na ako makatakbo matanda na ako i dont think ill even survive the five years pero pagka sinabi ko upakan kita upakan talaga kita to our employees and officials of the lgus tasked with monitoring these mining operations within their territorial jurisdictions do your job without fear or favor i  you absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure  the mining entities to comply — do not comply or comply with the guideli',\n",
       "  'nes rules and regulations governing mining operations and activities within your area of responsibility i mean it do not try to test my resolve absolutely i have nothing to lose except my life while we can control the acts of man no one can control  stop the fury and rampage of weather gone wild when nature fights back it does so with a vengeance we have seen the terrible toll that super typhoon yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property and we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those megatyphoons aside from droughts tempests and other problems taking shape which according to dost phivolcs — it is no longer just a distant possibility but a probability earthquakes the series of damaging quakes in leyte surigao and nearby provinces and islands attest to this we were told that it is no longer a question of ―ifǁ but a matter of ―whenǁ thus we need to act decisively and fast because the threat is huge real and imminent come to think of it really they say that there is no perfect instrument or human acumen can really predict earthquake i hope it will not come kasi kung magdating ̳yung sabi nila ̳yung ―big oneǁ i hope it will be just in the mountains and in the rural areas because if its right — sabihin nila tinatakot nila ang media kasi nandito eh in the speech i reviewed it last night i am calling  both houses of congress to expeditiously craft a law establishing a new authority or department that is responsive to the prevailing  century conditions and empowered to best deliver  enhanced disaster resiliency and quick disaster response while the law is  crafted with extreme urgency we need to undertake immediate action to ensure disaster resiliency and effective response in the greater  manila area which is our countrys seat of governance center of business commerce and the academe disaster resiliency of metro manila and the surrounding provinces is a matter of urgent  concern iyon nandito ̳yan tinatakot nila dito because of the highrise buildings and ilang tao ang nakatira diyan kung kaya kaya ito sa isang sinkhole i mean if it cracks and it goes down can we still manage to go up god huwag ngayon ha kay nandito ako hintayin mo lang ̳yan sila na lang sila dito nagaaway  i am directing the cabinet cluster on climate change adaptation and disaster risk management to immediately work hand in hand with the concerned lgus the private sector and the affected communities themselves in undertaking disaster  measures antidotes we all need to act fastwith all the foregoing said what then is the state of the nation today i will mince no words and neither will i windowdress the situation  we are in let me answer in two brief sentences we are in — for trouble — because we live in troubled and uncertain times and i fear that things might get worse before they become better but like i said i hope we will cope we hope and pray the west philippine sea issue and federalism are matters that we have to tackle sooner or later on the other hand despite our recent gains in improving the peace and order situation in the country there is still so much to be desired and if we are to completely eradicate the menace of illegal drugs criminality and corruption we must do it i therefore ask congress to act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes — especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs there is a shortage no no no there is a short clip of cnn about people in massachusetts was it there iyong clip nila ang ipinakita tiningnan pakitingin lang its repeated for almost every week yata ̳yang mga short clips tingnan mo ̳yung mga tao doon na hinayaan nilang mag they are there they live under the bridge they are getting thin they are doing nothing nakaganun lang sila tapos popose ng ano and they are aplenty there they do not work wala tapos sabi ng un is he here are you there iyong un representative na sinabi mo na shabu will not affect the brain are you here raise your right hand if youre here do not worry i will just do not — the word ―deludeǁ as into you iyong mga ano ninyo na — but we know everyday that one family raped dalawa and all are dead then you trivialize it with human rights and due process okay ako niyan when you go into an anger when you burst with rage okay ̳yan but with so many killings as brutal and as cruel as what happened if you add human rights and due process you stink and your mouth smells if you want to criticize criticize condemn the act stop there but do not give the excuse or do not make it trivial by saying human rights at least well be protected iyan ang pinakab na magawa ng isang tao when you criticize stick on one topic then you find an event where you can talk about human rights and due process but do not talk about it in the same time when there is a carnage and you begin to blabber talk about human rights lalong nagagalit ang tao eh p i mo may namatay na diyan akala mo kung sino ka  what have you done in the name of human rights seventyseven — you have the records you can summon the police seventy seven before i became president all drug related  and you trivialize that with a conference at tsaka pumunta dito ang tatanungin ̳yung nasa presuhan na pinireso dahil nag –— just imagine i challenge you you want a debate in public okay well have it i will challenge you how also you trivialize the thing by — ̳yung binibigyan niyo ng importansiya si de lima you all know you were all here you conducted the

the police but do not connect it with due process and human rights magmukha kang g sa harap ng pilipino you know why i get this rating i could not be brighter than you and my work is not more

kayo lang ang tagapigil eh it is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect tapos na ̳yan kindly for so long we have to act decisively on this contentious issue capital punishment is not only about deterrence it is also about retribution make no mistake about that iba kasi ako eh let us understand each other including the international community ang aming— our criminal system uses the revised penal code that is a law that was given to us by the spaniards the original revised penal code though it was translated into english and in this two books three books there are the definition of crimes and the penalties and everything and the thrust of that revised penal code ladies and gentlemen is the essence of retribution that is why you have penalties there is also the word ―positivist theoryǁ that you can nurture a criminal into goodness provided he goes to prison for two years three years hes released hes a sex offender when he goes out he rapes again kidnaps another girl and makes her a hostage for so many years ganun kayo eh admit it ganun kayo you are so too lenient about this son of a b a human being that has a virulent brain and his enemy is society and many at times there were sex offenders in america released only to rape and kidnap again and kill in just a few months after release in the philippines it is really an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth you took a life then you must pay for life that is the only way to even you cannot place a premium on the human mind that he will go straight nobody can not even your best scientist no one has ever fathomed how a person would react especially in committing crimes thats the only way to do it to instill fear that if you do it you will die thats the advantage of criminals and rebels and terrorists because they think that you are afraid to die thats why when i went to marawi i was asked by the media ―why are you hereǁ ―i am here because my soldiers are here and i came here to die alsoǁ  because any battle any fierce encounter you have to be of equal equanimity gusto siyang mamatay eh ̳di gusto ko ring mamatay they say that they use the name of god and the christians say ―we have the same thingǁ i read the ecclesiastes  what does it say even during elections there is a time to be great and a time for defeat a time to be in the skies emblazoned there and a time to be  somebody a time to have money a time to be hard up a time to just walk so many kilometers to school and a time for graduation and being a lawyer a time to be i dont know what i am now there ̳s always a time  ganun ̳yan eh so ill

lasting peace class be courteous do not make a noise the visitors are listening  just and lasting peace for a  nation we are pursuing an inclusive peace process promoting the participation of all stakeholders including those conflictaffected areas we took steps to promote inclusiveness in the bangsamoro transition commission btc by expanding its membership through executive order number  which i signed in november last year by giving representation to indigenous peoples women children and sultanates and key stakeholders in the drafting of the bangsa basic law we ensure a bangsamoro government that truly reflects the aspirations of our muslim brothers and sisters as well as our indigenous brethren  we have embarked on various initiatives to advance our national interest in the global community we pursue good relations with all nations anchored on an independent — on an independent foreign policy  — and the basic tenets of sovereign equality mutual respect and noninterference  as an independent nation we will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community we will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values we will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law sovereign equality and again non interference these are the principles that we are upholding as we advance to this year for the meeting as the chair of the asean we have cultivated warmer relations with china through bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms leading to easing of tensions between the two countries and improved negotiating environment on the west philippine sea at this point allow me to take a step back in time in  in  there was known as balangiga and that is eastern samar it was the time for philippineamerican war a combined group of filipino villagers and guerrillas in an effort to defend samar island from the alien invaders attacked and overwhelmed a us — a united states infantry garrison forty eight american officers and men were slain in the attack on the filipino side the casualty count was twentyeight killed and twentytwo wounded in retaliation us gunboats and patrols were sent to balangiga samar with the order to―make a desert of balangigaǁ and to reduce samar island into an island of ―howling wildernessǁ w',\n",
       "  'here every male citizen from the age of ten and above and capable of bearing arms would be put to death the church bells of balangiga were seized by the americans as spoils of war those bells are reminders of the gallantry and heroism of our forebears who resisted the american colonizers and sacrificed their lives in the process krag against bolo — krag was the standard rifle issued to the american troops and that is how the historians describe  mahirap talag kung director ka ikaw pa ang speech many historians describe —  the philippineamerican war that is why i say today give us back those balangiga bells  they are oursthey belong to the philippines  they are part of our national heritage isauli naman ninyo masakit ̳yun sa amin we now talk about our overseas filipinos they are our heroes they and their families have sacrificed much to the — for the country we all know how a large part of our economic — economy comes from their remittances that is why to ensure that their rights are protected i ordered the increase of our assistance to the ofw from  million pesos to more than  billion  we have been hard at work in securing the rights and welfare of our ofws a year ago i also warned government officials and employees that i will never tolerate corruption in my administration not even a whiff of it let the dismissal of several highranking officials — whom i myself appointed — serve as a warning to all that i will never back down on my commitment to cleanse this government and corporation  in order to bring government services closer to the people we established hotlines  government centers that receive public concerns one of which is the hotline  which allowed us to receive and immediately respond to emergencies we also launched hot — launched hotline  the citizens complaint hotline this is a public hotline facility that receives feedbacks or concerns on government services since we launched this hotline we have received numerous complaints from the public on government — slow government processing unclear or changing procedures and requirements centralized issuances of clearances and permits in metro manila and discourteous government employees among others ganito ̳yan time and again ̳yung — ̳yung pagtransact ng ordinaryo — no the ordinary people who contract business in government in the last asean ministerial conference i dont know why malacañang has to — my office has to do some work for — or the others like itong mga barong its always the — that outfit takes care of the attires that will be given to the ministerials this time to the heads of state alam mo id like to address this myself to government iyan bang bayaran pabalikbalikin ninyo ang tao alam i know that because ive been mayor for  years i never allowed it in my city but dito alam mo ̳yang mga sastre diyan sa parañaque hanggang cavite — ̳yung mga tailoring diyan — ang negosyo lang niyan involve boy scout teachers uniform girl scouts naghahabol ̳yan sila ng mga kontrata and they are just the — the stores that you find along the way until cavite they group together during times of ganito may asean and they look for a person to represent them this is not — no offense intended but — usually they look for beautiful women young who would do the talking arrangement you know because its the well its the reality of life that the beautiful women get the attention always tapos ̳pag nadeliver na nila nasukatan na pabalikbalikin ninyo and right there in malacañan it happened so i will fire the lady whoever was connected with her as i have fired everybody else a cabinet member for buying an  truck in austria that was not our contract it was a contract of the previous administration fourteen of those  million were already delivered this cabinet member was i was informed about and i said the legal — his legal office — to stopit you know what he went just right ahead traveled there signed something for the — another tranche of delivery so right there at the meeting — right in the cabinet meeting i said―were you able to read the opinion of your law — your own law officeǁ he said ―noǁ but sonny dominguez was already passing to me the — ̳yung sa iphone so i was reading it while i was talking to him sabi ko ―p i mo youre fired youre lyingǁ and so i fired him ―go out of this office i do not want to see your face againǁ ganon ako kaistrikto so ̳yung — the cabinet members — and they are here — theyre only given noon one year two years — one month the directors makinig kayo sa gobyerno bantay kayo directors youre only given  days and i do not want directors out of their office you eat your lunch there lahat kayong tagagobyerno so that you can resume to work immediately  now ito ang deal ko sa public there is the  i cannot stop corruption and wrongdoings if you do not cooperate you text me libre ̳yan —  you name the public official name his sins in that bulletin and i will take it from there do not be afraid about libel i will take care of that  iyon ang gawain ninyo i have to have your help kung hindi kasi kayo magano wala eh lahat pulis military lahat pati ako if you think that some of — may nagawa ako na masama sabihin ninyo do not be afraid we are all workers of government kayo ̳yung employer namin  we get the money from your pocket to our pockets kami — kailan pa since when have you heard me talk about government and officials i always address everybody ―workers of governmentǁ i seldom mention ―malacañan palaceǁ it is not a palace it is just a house of wood so why should i call it a palace maybe something like the europeanstyle i just call it office palace palace ka diyan eh  and besides all the rats of pasig are there  its just beside pasig river so ̳yung lahat ng mga daga diyan kung saansaan doon nagla landing it has a wild field and they are not killed because they are presidential mouse  iyon ang sabi ng — iyan o sundalo ―sir ̳di daw ipagbaril kay presidential mouseǁ p i mabuti pa ang mouse dito kay hindi pa pinapatay ̳yung tao kinakatay ninyo the peoples patience is wearing thin so is mine i am reiterating my directive to all government agencies  frontline services to our people — from womb to tomb — to further streamline their respective services to make these truly efficient and peoplefriendly we want to ensure that our people receive the quality services that they surely deserve minus the delays by the bureaucratic red tape i expect speedy reforms along this line well rightsize the national government let us trim the excess fat and add more muscle through the expeditious passage of ―the act rightsizing the national government to improve public service instituteǁ  i therefore urge congress to pass this at the soonest for the government owned and controlled corporations — isa pa kayo — the implementation of the existing salary standardization law pending r',\n",
       "  'eview in the compensation and position classification system excessive extravagant and unconscionable salaries and allowances incentives benefits and bonuses across the government owned or controlled corporations at this time in crisis youll have to pass by my office and i am not inclined to increase your allowances bonuses and salaries at this time wala ̳yan  you cannot do it on your own you have to direct it to the executive secretary and ill just tell you i am not inclined to give increases right now maybe seven years from now when drilon makes it to the presidency i also appeal to the supreme court to seriously consider the national interest and our development goals before issuing tros and injunctions on critical government projects and cases involving government assets i am just a coworker also ladies and gentlemen may i be allowed to be also just as frank tutal wala naman akong inaano eh i do not need to offend you but i cite for example the supreme court tro that prevents the department of health from distributing subdermal implants which caused a wastage of  worth of taxpayers money i also note that since its issuance two years ago this tro has impaired the governments ability to fully implement responsible planning — family planning methods in the rh law it is time that we put an end to the practice of some parties of resorting to technicalities in our laws to prevent the government from fulfilling its mandate ganito ̳yan maam eh tutal this is as good as any other time to talk to you and may i be understood by you — i am sorry to say this really i am — i do not intend to do it but if we have to talk about government and our sins which i am not an exception all our — you know — delays lahat naman tayo nagkakamali ganito ̳yan two things wala na talaga akong panahon ill just stay i dont know if i can make another sona again in the future its — its not for me to tell itong tro has been the bane of projects and even consunji ̳yang mga ayala nagaaway̳yan just to make you understand na hindi lang kayo tapos ̳yang tro na ̳yan would delay the projects now god — and im asking congress find me a law na kung may bidding naman at it was regular dapat ang korte or somebody else should not be messing it up because it can delay the projects which has been the case in the provinces alam mo magfile̳yan ng kaso — either it is really the truth and the coa will find out or makihati siya — ―i will withdraw the case and dissolve the tro of course but just give me a few —  percentǁ ganun ang ugali ng pilipino kaya ̳yang tro na ̳yan is the bane of our efficiency and i really do not know whether i will not attribute anything maam sa supreme court maybe i am at fault so i am sorry if i misquote or i did not have the complete facts but itong congress na ito passed the reproduction law it was already a law na dapat iimplement because we are really going into a family planning i am not for abortion i am not for birth control but certainly i am for the giving of the freedom to a filipino family the size ng pamilya niya  how many children would he be able to support and send to school ang nangyari nitong tro  sir maam may nagfile doon sa inyo — supreme court — tapos nagissue kayo ng tro two years ago in the meantime ̳yung — ang gobyerno nagbili ng medisina — ito subdermal pati itong mga pills worth  it was not really a reckless purchase it was in preparation for the implementation of the law hindi naman akalain na magtro and it has been two years the medicines will expire next month i told ubial the health secretary to find out if there is a nation who — which would allow it and i donate na lang rather than go to waste iyan ho ang nangyari i do not blame you you might have been very busy or something wala ako i ̳m just i am below you actually pero sinasabi ko lang may isa pa huwag na lang itong speech walang kwenta walang makukuha diyan  the bane — isa pa itong — the congress and tayo sa gobyerno including the judges and justices should understand that by this time ̳yung lowest bid ̳yun ang nagpopromote ng graft and corruption sa ating bayan  coa you are here malaman na lang ninyo na may violation ako doon sa military i do not allow them to bid and just to buy the weapons from everywhere because almost all countries are making arms tawag nila small arms industry were just fighting a rebellion true we do not need the armaments but diyan sa marawi you have to hit hard because they are prepositioned inside buildings and until now we cannot proceed fast because there are  hostages sabi ko ―do not assault if necessary well just have to wait wait it outǁ but we have to give food you do not — i do not care if they are moro or christians its not we do not have that luxury kasi ̳pag — there is a distinct possibility that we attack they will just behead everybody so find a way to do it if you cannot find a way to do it then just i said ―wait it outǁ sila ang nakatagal baka sabihin hindi marunong itong sundalo ako ̳yung pipigil initially sabi ko bomba ―eh sir hindi talaga madala sirǁ every window is occupied ̳yung highrise and we were losing because of the snipers and in there they hurry i said ―slow downǁ when i was — hindi ako nagyayabang — when i was in the camp sa ranao while i was briefing — i was being briefed by the military and was giving the instructions i heard about  pumutok at tsaka ̳yung bala na ―weng weng wengǁ iyong mga reporter nandoon sa likod ng stage kasi semento ̳yun eh we will ano sabi ko ―if this is how we should wait then well wait unless you can find a solution — somebody here who has a good even a horse sense to negotiate for the release ofǁ ayan itong isa babalik ko ̳yung lowest bid alam mo ganun ̳yan adre eh ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid ̳yung walang pera ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid sasabihin niya doon sa ano ―magbibigay po ako sa inyoǁ kung sinusino ̳yang mga opisyal so lowest bid papanaluhin siya so with no capital bibigay siya ng pera tapos ibigay lahat bigyan niya connected — lahat pagkatapos niyan if it is a  project he has to pay so many guys ang naiwan niya  — – out of the   million lang so that is the cost of the project so when i was campaigning for the presidency i was all over the philippines my god i could see a — the appropriation pero ang airport nila three meters long so ginawa na lang basketball court  and there is a province here hindi kayo not you if you look into the records back in time na puro na complex ang roads diyan talagang daan dito daan doon pero ̳pag pumunta ka isang daan lang its only one highway that is how corruption destroys the nation ngayon last i have to say this kailangan ko siya sabihin sir eh i was elected june  nag oath ako so july nagpunta na ako sa davao — sa afp medical center nakwento ko na ba ito sa inyo hindi pa tapos sabi ko — its quite familiar kasi i signed a le',\n",

bumabalik so i said ―you know i am really surprised youre military men why would you allow that kind ofǁ the dirt is going back to how do you expect the sailors to — the soldiers to get well tapos thats the only building the old — the oldest i said ―okay you rehabilitate it ill give you a new one in the meantimeǁ but last month i went to the back of my office doon sa barracks ng presidential

na lang ang magusap huwag na ̳yan sila t i wala pa hindi pa nadeliverǁ sus sinabi ko ―if this is the way how you treat our soldiers and they are dying now and that machine was ordered a year ago and then a coup détat a mutiny is not a surprise to meǁ kaya sabi ko kay ubial hindi niya kasalanan its because of the procurement pero ganun is secretary ubial here are you here secretary change the

rebellion sabi ko maski kung ako ang sundalo niyo and there is a machine already ordered it could have save my leg tapos wala maam ay p i magcoup détat ako and let us get the machine by ourselves i will not be surprised if its already in their minds ako i am only be too willing to step down but as a longterm solution i urge congress to thoroughly review our existing procurement laws and come up with legislation that will ensure the prompt delivery of quality goods and services to the people especially medicines and hospital equipment  kasi itong military ang sabi ko do not mind coa about i will answer for that since coa is here i limit it to three places where the military can buy the equipment because im sure that we will work and they can kill the enemies and make even our forces stronger or in parity with what they have on the other side itong armas sabi ko huwag mong sundin ̳yan i will explain to coa why huwag mo akong pabibilhin diyan sa mga lugar ng south america at lahat

learning system to ensure that filipinos are given equitable access to quality and affordable health services we expanded health insurance coverage and benefits the destitute and the indigents or

philippines we have to start putting value to our peoples wellbeing – because the success of every filipinos pursuit in life liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfilment of our aspirations as a filipino i would like to reiterate my personal and this administrations commitment to fully implement the magna carta of women to the barangay level tapos na ito  to this effect an executive order will be issued to local government units institutionalizing gender and development programs and services we are targeting to increase government spending on infrastructure from  percent of gdp in  to  percent of gdp by  amounting to a total of  to  trillion pesos or   to  billion dollars in infrastructure projects we will make the next few years the ―golden age of infrastructureǁ in the philippines to enhance our mobility and connectivity and thereby spur equitable growth and development in the country in other words we are going to build build and build to improve our sea connectivity we launched  brand new roro vessels to ply major nautical routes all over the country we also opened an asean roro shipping route connecting the ports of davao and general santos philippines to bitung

naman ibigay eh ̳di hanggang ngayon nandiyan pa ̳yung edsa okay lang at least gumanda lahat magiwan naman tayo ng pangit we will not make it all smooth in the philippines we leave a little alley known as edsa as the road to perdition but anyway since i could not get any funding i traveled to china and make friends with them and the ambassador is here ambassador zhao thank you for the help and as a matter of fact  willing he said ―if your congress has no money we will give you the moneyǁ and china has committed to build two bridges to span pasig river free of charge  so that you will be comfortable in crossing pasig anyway all of these strategic road and transport projects shall go to naught if we cannot free our streets which continue to be obstructed by illegally parked vehicles ̳yang edsa na ̳yan traffic obstructionists or undisciplined drivers who stop in the middle of the road and unsanctioned barriers in some areas i am directing the mmda and the lgus of metro manila as well as the lgus of metro cebu and of all our regional centers to ensure the free flow of traffic and immediately clear our roads and thoroughfares of all unnecessary obstruction including vehicles parked on the streets and barriers —   sanctioned by the government and penalize all traffic obstructionists regardless of stature sometimes hindi mo maano diyan because the police its a cabinet member pero may i have not – — authorized my cabinet member to utilize the low plate is it not for us to you just use an ordinary plate para walang masabi ̳yung tao i do not want you parking there when theres no parking please remove airports we are building new airports we might get some money also from china and will have new airports in the coming days we are now accelerating the implementation of the communications navigation surveillance and air traffic management system project which will result to ontime arrivals and departures better managed air traffic reduced flight operating costs and safer and more convenient travel experience revenues are the lifeblood of the government which enable us to provide for the peoples needs last may   we achieved the first step towards more equitable taxes to fund better services for the people i commend the house of representatives  for heeding my urgent certification of the tax reform by passing the first of five packages of the comprehensive tax reform program with an overwhelming  votes representing almost  percent of the filipino people the fate of the tax reform is now in the hands of the senate ano bang gustong ninyong gawain magluhod ako niyan well really ill leave it up to you we are all filipinos if you think thats a waste fine if you think its not good its okay with me i can survive  i call on the senate to support my tax reform in full and to pass it without haste  ayaw man magpakpak — ah pati si ano wala they are not clapping so si angara ayaw rin mag clap  bantay ka lang sa election tingnan mo  these reforms are designed to be propoor especially when the people understand how the revenues will be spent the passage of the tax reform law is needed to fund the proposed  budget which i am submitting here and today the poor and vulnerable  are at the heart of my tax reform your full support will ensure that the benefits of the tax reform can be felt immediately by them in the meantime the department of finance and bureau of internal revenue are strengthening and running after tax evaders  i have directed the department of finance and the bir to accept mighty corporations offer of  billion to settle its tax liabilities  after the settlement mighty will no longer engage in the tobacco business this will be the biggest tax settlement on record  it will produce a windfall for government which is significant since we face the unexpected costs of rebuilding marawi and ormoc the acceptance of the tax settlement offer does not preclude other criminal charges against the company that the bir may decide to file a settlement will allow government to avoid a long  battle that as we saw in previous cases could take years to resolve let this be a lesson to others this administration will spare no one found cheating the government of its due we view information and communications technology or ict as an effective medium to implement positive and meaningful changes in our society to this end my cabinet approved the national broadband plan of  to begin the work of bringing affordable internet access to every community and improving broadband connectivity in the country we have also installed free wifi internet in almost  public places around the country  we hope that the public will use them to access important information and services the national government portal which we launched recently will allow faster and easier delivery of public services and reduce the number of visits of the public to agencies for government transactions the digital terrestrial television broadcasting migration plan has also been launched the switch to digital from analog transmission will not only give a better tv viewing experience but also provide effective and reliable information to filipinos in times of calamities the governmentowned salaam digital tv the first muslim tv in the philippines is now already on test broadcasting  there are some of the things we have done for the past twelve months a more detailed narrative is contained in my report to the people will be released soon whether or not my first year of administration was a year of gains or a year of setbacks is not for me to say but for the people to judge i defer to the peoples judgment  my fellow citizens much remains to be done corruption persists like a fishbone stuck in the throat it pains and it is disconcerting we need to pry corruption from the government corpus  is deeply embedded we also need to put an end to squabbles and bickerings within agencies  focus fully on the speedy provision of quality public services to our people believe me it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubble nevertheless let us work

do what he believes is right and just and whatever be the opposition in terms of numbers and noise makes a majority for it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters  believe me i will end my term fighting it has been three years since i took my oath of office and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson the illegal drug problem persists corruption continues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives years ago we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs on may   our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists a group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks during that marawi siege tons of shabu worth millions and millions of pesos drug money killed  and wounded  of my soldiers and policemen in that fivemonth battle i am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace let the reason why i advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs and through the barangay formation of antidrug councils and also actually surrendering bricks of cocaine found floating in the sea into our islands i call this responsibility however the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive i respectfully request congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes  related to drugs as well as plunder my countrymen it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed our principles from our prejudices the real from the fake and the truth from a lie the reason is because that many of us what matters above all is the self it is selfishness  its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement to borrow the language of f sionil jose we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests our warped loyalty to family friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors our foreign investors local and the business sector in this country the recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients i am grossly disappointed the government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many thus i ordered the nbi to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable i appointed a new philhealth president whom i know is a man of integrity a military man a former military officer and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption by the way i commend the bureau of investigation for its handling of high profile cases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals these culprits will have their day of reckoning in court i hope it happens during the last three years of my

interconnection of our islands and cities by air land and sea are secretaries tugade and villar alam naman ninyo magaganda na ang airport ninyo inuna ko nga kayo eh everybodys complaining about the davao airport and i said davao will be the last kung hindi na maabutan sabi ko mga tagadavao pasensya na kayo para walang masabi ang congress sa atin baka nga  sila doon sa kabila we also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider do not worry about this there is no corruption at all i guarantee you upon the grave of my father i do not allow — i do not talk to them i just say just do your work and kung maaari according to what the specifications are required by this government i challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people especially in the underserved areas dict secretary honasan will be the lead man in this endeavor i hope he is here  however developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order yang peace and security wala yan we need to enforce the law after almost two decades of peace negotiation the bangsamoro organic law was finally passed and ratified for decades our muslim brothers in the armm have been mired in poverty my late muslim brother minda chair abdul khayr alonto envisioned a progressive peaceful and united mindanao during our lifetime it is my hope that the bangsamoro transition will fasttrack the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for muslim brothers and sisters and all indigenous communities in the bangsamoro regions additionally i have taken the helm of the national task force to end local communist armed conflict and have assigned a cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development  security through the exceptional leadership of secretary briones and the deped i am proud to say that

       "  'ear more filipino learners are receiving basic education with over  million enrollees from kinder to senior high school  and because we have still a little to spare the fastest population growth one of the — is the philippines we are so industrious that we are producing more people than  i do not want to quarrel with the religious but more than  — sorry my eyes is not good — for the isinusuot ko lang to pag mag — paminsanminsan eh outofschool youth and adult learners were able to access nonformal education through the alternative learning system for our national sports development i support the proposed measure to create the national academy of sports for high school students  almost  micro small and medium enterprises or the msmes have received over  billion worth of loans since  thanks to the efforts of secretary lopez and the dti additional benefits for solo parents  the assignment of health workers in all barangays and the expansion of the malasakit centers are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of bong go  para manalo sa kampanya yon ang mantra niya totohanin mo lang bong mapahiya tayong lahat  i also implore congress you — look you have to study this very carefully congress has to postpone the may  elections and yung barangay sangguniang kabataan to october  because if you read it this  to rectify the truncated terms paibaiba na eh the truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects i suggest congress should also enact the magna carta for barangays  this administrations malasakit at serbisyo program has of course reached the filipinos who labor in foreign lands the milestone signing of the bilateral labor agreement with kuwait in  is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas filipinos to ensure their welfare protection and their access to government services the establishment of the department of overseas filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need  our accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my midterm report to the people copies of which shall be made available before the day ends let me repeat what i said many times before honestly i have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in i have met the enemy facetoface and sadly the enemy is us we are our own tormentors — addressing the filipino people — we are our own demons we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless the weak and the voiceless we find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohorts back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act for the boys sponsoring an event or whatelsehaveyou no amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense it is an injury laced with insult it is both a national embarrassment and a national shame for every transaction a commission for every action extortion and a request that goes on and on – endlessly and shamelessly catharsis is what we individually and collectively need to do today – not tomorrow but today selfpurgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper is good for the nations health let me ask you when will corruption end kailan ba talaga to hanggang kailan well i dont know ive been in — with government for almost  years now i am not singling out myself its the entire gamut of our system corruption exasperates it frustrates it is also exasperating that there are times when i think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches of course it is only a thought i am simply thinking aloud to dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else words of pedro guerrero who said sometimes they write what i say and they write — and they write what i say and not what i mean so yung mga papurgapurga lang diyan i use similes metaphors hyperbole and other figures of speech every now and then to prove or stress a point i am as human as anybody else on the matter of the philippine — west philippine sea the avoidance of conflict — armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act a shooting war is grief and misery multiplier war leaves widows and orphans in its wake i am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction more widows and more orphans should war even on a limited scale breaks out more and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public that is why i will do in the peaceful way mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake short of expressly advocating a call to arms there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone of course we will do in due time there ',\n",
       "  'is alam mo ganito yan eh noong — when i became president and when the  rifles were cancelled by america upon the prodding of the us congress i found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in marawi and because of the arms were already — mostly in the hands of the police handsmedown from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy so i was forced to go to china eh mabutit na lang nasabi ko sa inyo to then in china we had a bilateral i brought along the military man — año the chief of staff then and all of them lorenzana esperon national security in that meeting i said — cabinet members were there — i want to go to my territory to dig oil that was the word i dig because that is ours ang sabi ni president xi well you know there is a conflict there do you think rather than go there and have a confrontation — not necessarily the grey ships war ships but you know a squabble there could lead to something else sabi niya we just became friends and perhaps we can talk about this but not an outright precipitate move because he said it softly it can mean trouble if the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president of a republic anong magawa ko so what did i answer well then maybe sir we can talk about this at some other time but definitely before i go we must talk about the west philippine sea we cannot you know have our cake and eat it too you know i cannot go there even to bring the coast guard to drive them away china also claims the property and he is in possession yan ang problema sila yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner we are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nagstandoff doon during the time of my predecessor si albert ambassador if im correct i do not know his real name tayo ang umatras pagsabi niya umatras that was a kind of a compromise tayo ang umatras noong umatras tayo pumasok sila marami na that day we lost the spratly and the panganiban island iyan ang totoo walang bolahan yan ngayon may arbitral ruling i i said i could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the anong sabihin ko sa kanila kaya sinabi ko let us do this mutually of course when xi says i will fish who can prevent him and sabi ko naman we will fish because we claim it and sabi ko please allow because before that they were driving away our fishermen di ba inaabog nila kaya sabi ko do not drive them away because the filipinos are of the belief that they are also — they claim it now if you deprive — deprive the filipinos of — there magkagulo talaga yan and it could lead to ano — not really war and i said we have to kaya ang sabi ko when i said i allowed that was on the premise that i own the property pero hindi tayo in control of the property ayan magsabi sila of course i will allow you kaya pinabalik eh yung disgrasya yung pagsabi a mere incident — legal marine incident yan ang ginagamit sa batas yan a marine incident happened hindi naman sinasabi na marine accident it was just nabanggan wala naman so they wanted to talk tapos ayaw dito and so so sige we will investigate and you investigate and when you are ready we should meet and compare notes and let us determine who pays for what damage ganun lang ipadala ko yung marines ko to drive away the chinese fishermen i guarantee you not one of them will come home alive kung ipadala ko yung limang — pati yung frigate ko na bago yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni trillanes diyan sa — that made bong a senator ubos yan because there are already guided missiles in that island and the fastest that they have installed there can reach manila in seven minutes you want war alam mo asaran yan eh supladuhan yan kung supladuhan lang murahin p i mo l ka umalis ka diyan kung ganunan lang bright ako diyan hanggang bunganga lang pero kung bunutan na ng baril ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang but the problem is there — whether we do it in a diplomatic way there will be heated arguments sigurado yan we do it in a confrontation doon we try to drive them away it could lead to a violence any way yan by the way the president answered when i said i will dig my oil the first time i went to china nakita ko yung tao eh so you can more or less draw a profile of his please do not do that because there will be trouble ano anong magagawa ko i go there i said the fisheries who were and besides i was invoking yung traditional fishing rights it is in that arbitral ruling ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan it is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations and that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between finland and germany decided by unclos — unclos and the international law of the seas unclos is a product of a treaty that treaty is also a part of our land because we are a signatory eh kung basahin l',\n",
       "  'ang ninyo yan nang husto it is there you might just china and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments that law is a humane law so im sorry i have to i promised you  minutes my god i you want me to stop we can go home now  i have exceeded my there is the you know there is a time for everything do not believe the others because they are not my friends they are my political enemies they said i do not believe in god who says i am a believer of a universal mind there but  i do not believe that a god so perfect would create hell for his creation what kind of god is he he is not my god there is a time to — for everything a time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy with your political opponents or with your wife that is why some lives here are and a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war and a time to live and a time to die thats ecclesiastes  our ownership of the philippine — west philippine sea is internationally recognized however both the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and the arbitral award in the case of people — republic of the philippines vs peoples republic of china recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal states exclusive economic zone the arbitral ruling even states the one that they are charging me for violating the constitution sino gani yon suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa nandito eh the arbitral ruling even states that the philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states provided certain conditions and requisites in the unclos are met so yung akin sabi niya lets go fish sabi ko you have to act you know they have been there fishing since time immemorial i think it was adam who got the first lapulapu there let me assure you that national honor and territorial integrity shall not — shall be foremost in our mind and when we may take the next steps in this smoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling the west philippine sea is ours there is no ifs and buts it is ours but we have been acting  along that legal truth and line but we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today poverty incidence fell from  percent in the first half of  to  percent in the first half of  the most important number though is the six million filipinos we need to pull out from poverty kindly help me on this and you know as i said corruption is everywhere you are free to investigate i dont take offense if there is anything wrong in my department the executive you are free to open the investigation anytime you do not have to call me call the idiots expose them and send them to jail you are helping me do not be i am not ive been a prosecutor i know how it works feel free feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law we have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs i therefore implore congress to immediately pass package  of the comprehensive tax reform program or the trabaho bill which shall gradually lower the income — corporate income tax and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives it will energize our msmes and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate hopefully — im missing the word hopefully para sabihin na youre all talk — hopefully  million jobs in the coming years the msmc — msmes hold the promise of raising a lot of the filipinos i therefore believe that it is now time for congress to approve a new version of the salary standardization law ngayon na  and to the teachers alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young kasali na po dito yung hinihingi ninyo hindi naman masyadong malaki pero it will tide you over during these hard times a little bit bigger than before  this is intended to increase the salaries of national government workers including teachers and nurses nurses correct  i am also asking congress to pass the remaining packages of my administrations tax reform program and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on — very good let us do it — tobacco and alcohol sinong naninigarilyo dito they should be exterminated from the face of the earth  they are the ones you know i im i do not hide my— whats wrong with me i acquired buergers disease because i smoke but i made it a national policy because you know when i was new mayor i went around to see the discos and night clubs i could hardly see the faces of the people inside you have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognizeone so thats when i decided but i was still smoking but i decided because i knew i already had it so its time to — sabi ko and a national law para lahat na that at  o clock everything closes i am not trying to pull a chair here mine was that two oclock noon sa davao it was two then i reduced it to one when that boxing mayor there became mayor she reduced it to six walang order no orders in advance kasi we have ordered already so you can close but we have to drink itong ngayon at  everything closes down nobody wor',\n",
       "  'ks so i i think that we should adopt it most of the states in many states in many countries ganun man alas dose sarado na talaga we have to stop drinking and jukebox theyre only good up to eight nine eight maganda yan its a its there in every corner store blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class and you are there with your store i have prohibited it in davao and at  as you see davao is quiet because everybody is resting already be it in the memorial parks cemetery or inthe comfort of their homes the valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income  i urge congress to review and pass the government rightsizing bill to reconfigure the existing metro manilacentric bureaucracy streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline these reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a new poor every time a disaster strikes the philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and — are poverty creators that is why we need to hasten the establishment of a department of disaster resilience ddr so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change i urge congress to fasttrack the passage of the administration of this bill — administration version rather in  i reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in metro manila and its surrounding provinces since then i have established the project management office for the earthquake resilience and the greater manila area to implement twopronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts i just heard its not in my speech i just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the big one hits will be right here in the center ofthis  yan man ang sabi nila philippines is so corrupt its so lousy that if you kill all congressmen senators and the president we will have a newday  so i pray that if the earthquake comes it comes now this moment  kumpleto na tayo may madamay pa tayo doon sa harap  we weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year the el niño were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater metro manila area we need to pass bill creating the department of water resources and water regulatory commission  alam mo the agencies and the guys there handling the — the entire water works system — you have to change it immediately you know what there was this threeday no water i was in davao so everybody was complaining and i was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to – — to take a bath  she will smell like hell so i said ill wait for the water to wash her alam mo kung hindi ako nagmura kung hindi ko sinabi p i papatayin ko kayo p i niyo and then when i arrived in the morning there was water and my girlfriend was fresh  i also call on congress to pass a law mandating a fire protection modernization program diyan tayo nagkaano if you go to davao youll find the best the best of everything  all the cameras all the screens we did that if you can find it alam mo — alam mo sabi ni is there sonny is here secretary dominguez ah sonny siya man ang magyayabang sabi niya marami tayong pera pero pag tanungin namin siya doon sa cabinet meeting tsk tsk tsk tsk walang pera walang pera  si diokno ganun rin kaya gitapon ko sa central bank  every time sabihin mo you know we discussed projects we plan and we submit it to congress its final imprimatur eh di kami ang may pera ba tayo diyan sir wala magkano four billion tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice no money no money p saan pala ang pera natin dito sa bulsa ninyo  karaming collection natin dito but sonny says that we can fund this one we have to answer now i would like to remind pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat alas sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo hindi pala kayo nag merienda alam mo ever since naintegrate yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself wala ng mga truck luma na and would you believe it in davao city ill show it to you we have a studebaker fire truck maganda pa so we have to — we have to do better than this there are other cities which are utterly — – utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire we have to come up with something that is really good i mean at this age it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days three days my god we have to set aside sonny you have the money  oh yes oh see basta sa maraming tao mahiya man magdeny  totoo yan totoo yan we have the money so maybe sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside nakakahiya talaga itong ano natin ang davao meron davao has a very good  hindi ako nagyayabang and we have cameras in every corners thats why we can solve crimes immediately and meron kaming  what is your emergency thats the standard so its fire they call the fire department sabi ko  yes whats your emergency i — i seemed to lost my –— to have lost my girlfriend we know you mayor you go back to manila there are plent',\n",
       "  'y left there go  this will equip the fire — bureau of fire protection with tools to respond to the challenges i further ask congress to urgently pass the na — ito — the national land use act or nalua within this year  paki lang po so that we can proceed with the new well we can meet the — the demands of the new investors coming in ang lupa natin ang problema eh a sciencebased national land use plan would serve as basis for the lgus in crafting respective development plans and help disperse economic activities to the countryside the dispersion of economic and business activities to visayas and mindanao is not just a campaign promise it is an economic imperative and a key to our countrys sustainable and equitable development we will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and metro manila and other mega urban areas let me cut here tutal maliit na lang i would just like to remind everybody no offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government pero yang style ninyo na it takes about three days four days for the employees of a certain company store or whatever to go back and forth back and forth when they go back you have a new regulation he gets it he secures it and when he goes back oh theres still you have to follow — you have to get this paper i will tell you now hindi ako nagyayabang in davao its one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection i am directing you publicly mayors — mayors i am directing also the dilg secretary año of the local government to see to it that this is honored all clearances permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval must be out at the very least within three days  you do not do that i am directing si secretary año is he here sir nandito ka oh secretary año he is the former chief of staff hes also a military man i want three days unless there is an exceptional reason three days para hindi na magpa balikbalik kasi diyan ang perahan eh

pati yang tsk — easement well under villar okay na pero yang easement billion dollar — ah billion pesos well if its a foreign company its a billion dollar thing ganun yan pabalikbalik at hindi binabayaran thats why nagpatong if all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith marami tayong pera im telling you as president marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the — the mass of filipinos who are suffering maski ospital lang and housing jobs its the economy that runs it if the economy is good more jobs at the meantime itong hospitalization education the basic things at saka itong relocation kaawa talaga kung makolekta lang lahat hindi macorrupt ang pera marami tayong pera kaya ako nagsabi thats why i — i resi you know i will make it public i was at the

abutan ako ng topak magbaba dito ako ngayon bahala na kayo diyan im going home one ese — one estimate pegs economic losses at  billion a day due to traffic congestion in metro manila so meantime i reiterate my directive my request my pleadings to the mmda and all concerned local officials in metro manila and all other cities to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends marami diyan  and again i asked secretary año to see to it that this is enforced if there is a mayor or a governor or kung ano kang — sino kang demonyo ka i suspend mo sir año give him time and if he cannot — if he is not up to it then pagpahingain mo na lang suspend mo na wala talagang — wala tayong magawa they just keep on pleasing their own constituents just because they are constituents — a leader ganun kayo eh the only way to do it anyway me i have no problem me i am an inutil official me i cannot run anymore me after six years i might lose my head wala na ako i no more challenges in politics no more mountains to climb i will just do my duty and most of my cabinet members are actually military men you know why gusto ninyong malaman do not be embarrassed atinatin na lang itohuwag mo na silang pansinin yang mga ano diyan parang nag meeting meeting lang tayo dito  yung parang nagpulungpulong lang do not mind them eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo kasi ganito yan my penchant for military men i want to ingratiate myself to them what i was elected by the people not by the military not by the police but to — why do i have this i said — this predisposed of kasi utusan sila madali kasi pag sinabi mong walang corruption walang corruption kaya lang ang military and just like any organization pag ang top diyan general o ang commanderinchief corrupt kucorrupt yan lahat pero kung sabihin mo na matino ka they will follow so boracay isent cimatu sabi ko puntahan mo nga doon is general cimatu here si roy ah yeah itong si roy nakilala ko ito sa mindanao hindi ko man yan kilala mindanao namayor kasi ako  years so all of them passed by mindanao kilala ko pag inutusan mo kaagad and they know that i will not give illegal orders for them to implement alam nila abugado ako sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo kaya i was surprised when i ordered cimatu to go there — to boracay sir frank alam mo ang ginawa niya the next day lumabas siya roon sa daily mirror naglalakad siya doon sa beach nakatshirt ng blue at yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawang caucasian na nag  g it cimatu akala ko ba inutusan kita yes sir o bakit ka nagpalakadlakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo yung nakabikini na dalawang puti sir napadaan lang ako sir sabi ko trabahuin mo yan ha and they did it in six months time of course with a  i like cimatu because he mixed his pleasure with work  that is the way how to do it i give you until the last week of the year yung sa — september na to do this clean the lgus walang mangyari dito we shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk we shall ensure the full implementation of the rice tariffication law including the rice competitiveness enhancement fund this will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries seeds and credit and extension services i also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives — ito — coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent —– ah through the urgent utilization of the coconut levy fund that is  million  kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha look it is really hard to look for an honest man i must admit it baka ako hindi ko rin kaya i do not have that well itong coco fund na ito ito yung naiwan sa — noong kay marcos na levy fund this is sacred money this money was taken out of the pockets of the filipinos arbitrarily wala kang magawa noon eh martial law ito na yan kaya itong coco levy fund kung sabihin mo lang tama ang supreme court hindi mo pwedeng maibigay — sabi mo sino you can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land ang plano ko kung gusto ninyo you save the money you invest the money siguro magabot yan ng mga more than  billion ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government its about mga  billion ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao you cannot — sabi ng supreme court tama sila —– you can no longer trace the genealogy of the owners — the original owners andsometimes it would fail i will not act on that until i find the money wala pa akong nakuha i h',\n",
       "  'ave yet — i have yet to look for the money hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako wala akong makita kasi malaki ito and this will — this will you know if you assign a corrupt idiot there kaya gusto — ang gusto ko o baka nagustuhan rin ninyo ideposito ko na lang let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah — at that time tapos yung  billion yon yung to improve the econo — the improvement sa replanting sa coconut five billion thats a big money pero kung ibigay mo let it sprinkler walang mangyayari yung tagabigay kukuha yan — yung pupunta thats why itong land bank na ito pag hindi ito na you know you are called land bank but you are now the number one commercial bank in the philippines what the heck is happening to you you are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors bakit wala  bakit — why cant you just buy a few wagons or whatever go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives tulungan ninyo to form one  pag wala eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut —– to revive the coconut industry pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money — nung sabi ko of the coconut levy that is sacred money land bank should go back to land why are you mired in so many commercial transactionsbumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers ilang administration na wala  you better decide on that i will give you until the end of july to give me a plan or else i will ask congress to reconfigure you whatnot wala eh wala kayong  im asking now congress pag wala sila — if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their development funds  o mas makatulong pa diretso eh ayawninyo  o ayaw daw nila sir frank huwag mo na lang galawin i once again urge both houses of congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the coconut farmers trust fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the wellbeing and empowerment of the coconut farmers  we recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones in this regard i trust that secretary cusi shall fasttrack also the development of renewable energy sources and reduce dependence on the traditional energy sources such as coal finally sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats defense secretary lorenzana together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces is at the forefront of this fight we expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense related systems such as the proposed national defense act the unified military and uniformed personnel separation retirement and pension bill and the revival of the mandatory rotc in grades  and   very important alam mo pag mag giyeragiyera  out of  hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters itong mga bata ngayon they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country balik sila dito i think a military training would be good for everybody kung hindi sige lang— sa shabu mamaya namatay krrrkkk duterte extrajudicial killing report to the icc ah okay if you can provide me with a good comfortable cell heated during winter time i want to go — and an airconditioned during hot weather and a conjugal visits unlimited  para we can understand each other we are aware of the fact that there are times in afp and pnp personnel while in the performance of their duties get unjustly sued providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale my fellow citizens to

       " [' of rodrigo roa duterte  to the congress of the philippines session hall of the house of representatives  kindly sit down by far this is the most beautiful sona crowd that ever happened here  so many — so many beautiful faces and you only have to guess when you see the full face of the person senate president vicente sotto iii and the honorable members of the senate house speaker lord allan jay velasco and the honorable members of the house of representatives vice president maria leonor robredo former presidents fidel v ramos gloria macapagalarroyo joseph ejercito estrada the chief justice alexander gesmundo and the justices of the supreme court executive secretary salvador medialdea and the members of the cabinet dean of the diplomatic corps his excellency archbishop charles john brown and the distinguished members of the diplomatic corps my fellow government workers and of course to my lovely wife honeylet mga mahal kong kababayan  when i assumed the presidency five years ago dominant in my mind were dreams and visions of a better life for all filipinos i saw them as reachable through the institution of reforms and radical changes in both the structure of government and the mode of governance — changes designed  responsibility  accountability all in consonance with the truth that public office is a public trust when i ran for the presidency i just made fundamental promises and strangely you can count them by the fingers of your hand i made those changes which i thought that was really at that time doable to offer free education — its there already — the universal health care  nandiyan na po the fight against illegal drugs  criminality and corruption and the development of infrastructure including free irrigation and other big ticket projects which i thought i did not have the funds to do it but per chance among others they were done in my term today as i approach the end of my term i have less visions but more remembrances but mine is not to rue or to second guess what might have been but to bear and respond with urgency  of unforeseen events as they unfold even before i took my oath of office  – and everyone else i suppose – knew the gravity  enormity of the problems that the country was facing and precisely because of that awareness i was driven to hasten the implementation of changes which i believed the country needed keeping in mind that the constitution afforded me only six years to make those changes happen making a difference within the constitutional timeframe is what i was up against but no one gets by legally without worming through the needles eye of constitutional imperatives that is why i cajoled i shoved i pushed and i tangled with men of wealth and influence who were oblivious to the anguish and pleas of the weak and impoverished and for that i was pilloried to no end but i did not succumb to the attacks and neither did i allow criticisms however intense to dampen my determination and initiatives because my purpose was pure and unpolluted  while we were busy instituting reforms the twin ogres of illegal drugs and corruption laid low for a while only to resurface us — still with us and make no mistake about it corruption is but another term for stealing peoples money dashing in its wake a nations goals and aspirations due to the brilliant programs and excellent work of our economic managers and the extraordinary cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of government our economy with investor confidence was poised to leapfrog into the company of the worlds fastest growing economies until the  pandemic stalled everything be that as it may allow me this opportunity to extend my personal and the nations gratitude to all those who selflessly gave their all in the fight against  our health workers and other frontliners who risked their own safety  to keep our essential health services and our food supply chain running  economic activity and ensure peace and order in our communities i would like also to extend my deepest appreciation for the generosity of the private sector who came to the governments aid in fighting   i am profoundly thankful for your sustained assistance to our fellow filipinos  amidst the same deleterious effect of the pandemic to your respective industries let me assure you that the government is committed to assist the private sector to regain the commercial vibrance of the country prior to the pandemic  to our local  executives this pandemic pushed you to step up and deliver responsive assistance i am glad to have seen you undertake new and heightened responsibilities working doubly hard to protect your constituents  to the international development partners who extended a helping hand amidst the global health emergency the philippines remembers your kindness and goodwill with sincere gratitude  and to all of you who answered the call to protect one another by adhering to our nations  protocols daghang salamat  but then let me ask perhaps you and to myself what exactly is the state of the nation today in the light of the pandemic which has paralyzed business activities and crippled even the strongest of the worlds economies so where do we go from here  in my first sona i laid down with utmost commitment and resolve the overall direction of my presidency a comfortable life for all filipinos anchored on a peoplecentered approach to development and governance if i remember correctly my administration i said will implement a human approach to development and governance in our peoples welfare in the areas of health free education adequate food and housing environmental preservation and respect for the culture i bore no illusion that steering the nation towards a comfortable life for every filipino would be easy indeed the past five years have truly been challenging and humbling i stand here before you today bearing no conceit but if there is one thing that i could be proud of is that not once did i waver in doing the unpopular even if it meant upholding the greatest good for the greatest number  before i took office our country was beset with a communist insurgency scattered across the nation a separatist movement that sought to divide us on the basis of religion and religious differences and the proliferation of illegal drugs and criminality our armed forces were illequipped to deal with internal and external threats while the police force had been overwhelmed by criminality and the drug trade problem this is why i made it a priority to strengthen the institution and boost the morale of the men and women of the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police and other armed services  again i thank congress for working with the executive department in enhancing the capabilities of the afp and the pnp through our modernization program in  we raised the salaries of our military and uniformed policemen and personnel  to a level commensurate to the critical role they play in upholding national security and maintaining order i am asking congress to pass a unified system for separation retirement and pension of military and uniformed personnel to maintain  government fiscal flexibility and provide adequate benefits and remuneration to our men and women in uniform this shall apply only to the new entrants of the military and  services hindi ho lahat it cannot be that we have to pay so many even the salaries of the retired they get a chunk of the big budget and if we include the new entrants the funds available for them would not be enough it is also high time for us to pass a law providing free legal assistance to afp and pnp officers and enlisted personnel  to help  them from charges arising from incidents related to the performance of official duty  the continuous upgrading of our defense capability shall ensure that we shall uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty from external and  security threats among the new additions  we welcomed the countrys two missilecapable warships ',\n",
       "  'to enable us to protect our seas by providing them with the necessary equipment by enhancing their professional capabilities and looking after the families of the soldiers who would not be longer be in their company we do not only strengthen our military and police institutions — we also inspire them to serve this nation with the highest degree of loyalty and patriotism we enabled them to carry out their mandate to defeat all enemies of the state whatever the cost indeed i am proud of the accomplishments of our troops in securing our nation against all threats to our democratic institutions  but peace must be realized — peace and security is not only just a military concern that is why we deviated from the traditional purely military approach in dealing with matters of national security with the creation of the national task force to end  communist armed conflict or ntfelcac  we have made great strides in addressing the root causes of this conflict by empowering our kababayans who have been used by the communists for so many decades in our continuing effort to build safe and conflictresilient barangays we have worked towards the sustainable rehabilitation and development of communities where the communists used to operate through the ntfelcac we invested in farmtomarket roads school buildings water and sanitation   health stations and livelihood  alam mo kasali na tayo dito lahat always every law or every regulation must pass congress of course to the president but sometimes you know in our well in the performance of our duties we encounter the notsonice of confronting each other but because of these interventions more than  former communist rebels have surrendered to the government they have returned to the fold of the law and are happily reintegrating to   or eclip  its either i am talking too fast or too slow or the operator of this thing here is drowsy  maybe because i had so many ad libs along the way marami ho akong akin lang kaya yung  nahinto ako when i stop and i process something in my — the gray matter between my ears — hindi humahabol o hindi alam ng operator hindi bale maam mahal pa rin kita  lalaki ba ito o yung mga babae kagabi yung mga babae sila o sabihin mo sa kanila makipagkita ako mamaya i will embrace them for their punctuality in operating this ano — this strange machine that  gives you the speech with the support of our local government units i am confident that support for the communist movement will continue to erode in the next few months  and like the decadesold moro rebellion in mindanao we will also bring an end to the armed struggle of the communists once and for all  sa totoo lang itong komunista college pa ako hanggang ngayon ang mga — sige pa rin so speechspeech man lang ito kunwari lang pero ang totoo theres a lot of fighting going on in the countryside but id like to credit the police and the military for destroying so many communist fronts  i think they have destroyed more than  apparatus of the fronts of the communist party of the philippines alam mo magistorya muna tayo sa taxation id like to be frank with you everybody as everybody in this country are paying taxes to the communists the communist party earns billions but pass on a little to their fighting men who die for an ideology that is so rotten and corrupt they themselves are pocketing the money and their children are studying in europe and in other places which i think none of you here can finance such journey iyan ang masakit dito they collect taxes support sison in netherlands and they do nothing but badmouth the government and mouth the war dogmas and everything hindi na sila napagod its about  years in the making and until today the poor people are dying the cadres and most of them belonging to the indigenous tribes of our country are fighting a losing battle between the communist and the government they waste lives they enlist children and they are proud of it but they deny it but when you go to the mountains such as i and senator go many times even during the elections they were there with so many arms that i think somebody — an idiot here in the philippines supplied the firearms id like to ask congress especially senator bato kindly dig on because we have identified the person who imported the  into this country on the pretext of using it in the security — providing security and guards in all in business establishments and for those who can afford their home this policeman i think is still there he was a colonel and he is still walang nangyari at maraming sundalong namatay dahil sa mga armas na pinasok nila dito sa pilipinas so that my orders to the — to you if you see them walking around kindly shoot them dead i would be happy anyway you are already charged in the icc together with me so what is the problem of adding another one another idiot filipino who has caused great damage to our country iyan ho ang totoo diyan at itong mga pulis but let me go back in time when i first said i will fight drugs in six months i thought it was like in davao you can either coerce intimidate or bribe them or give them money i said lumabas kayo ng davao doon kayo magkalat sa luzon at sa ibang lugar huwag dito sa davao naniniwala naman ang mga ulol at we were able to attain a sense of normalcy in the city iyon ho ang totoo there are people charged with corruption and even going to prison for just maybe not telling the truth in their itong assets and liabilities nakukulong eh p itong mga pulis who are doing their thing their drugs they were the manufacturers and they were the distributor of drugs when i became president i asked dela rosa — he was the chief of police of my city — i promoted him direct to be pnp chief four star na kaagad automatic but i told them i told him and the others look for the enemies look where — for where they are and if you find them destroy the apparatus destroy all from the manufacturers to the peddlers because we are fighting a drug war that was being participated in the business by nine generals of the pnp kaya yan ang masakit sa loob ko i did not know that i was fighting my own government customs and everyone else were facilitating the importation of drugs and one importation as you can see it every night on tv the police now seize about almost a billion worth of drugs everyday and if you look at the  there are about a thousand filipinos arrested everyday by the police in connection with drug trafficking and that is why i go crazy looking at the situation they are still around we do not have the laboratories now because nawala na sila at itong naiwan ngayon are doing the importation the citizens of another country cooked their shabu in their —  — in their tugboat or something and they threw out the product in — contained in the plastic bags and with gps attached to the contraband so that the importers here could find them easily that is how we are fighting almost losing a battle against drugs and now the  gangsters of mexico and the triad of laos in that area they are busy cooking and we have the filipinos here with no — with nothing in their mind except to destroy a nation — distributes them that is what i said ive been asked the question and several times i gave the answer i am a filipino and i love my country i do not want my country in disarray because of drugs i do not want families break up and become dysfunctional iyon ang masakit sa akin when there — if you want to destroy a family look for a way of the member or a resident of that family home bigyan mo ng droga pag nandiyan na yung droga at they are hooked and that is the end sometimes families are separated because of drugs becomes dysfunctional at yung mga asawa magpunta doon sa abroad ika nga to look for jobs and you know in the middle east — i am not attributing it to any particular country — but there are tribes in the middle east who are employing our filipina citizens and they are uniform everybody who comes here home ask them how many hours of sleep they have they said ',\n",
       "  'its only three to four hours and the food is hogwash and they sacrifice because they send money to the families back home and thinking all the time that the money was spent usefully only to realize when she comes home that that family has already dispersed to nowhere bakit yan because itong mga durugista sa baba itong peddlers itong basurero tawag — its a street lingo — they look for families na may mga nanay tatay nagtrabaho — ang tatay or nanay nagtatrabaho sa abroad and to think na iniiwan nila ang mga anak nila kung saansaan na lang to their neighbors at a tender age of three to four five it breaks your heart iiwan lang nila sa kapitbahay kung walang mga relatives and then when they come back five years four years after they now realized that their young sons and daughters have gone into prostitution because of drugs and their boys or the fem — the male are nowhere to be found and into the drug business also iyon ang pinakamasakit masakit sa akin na ang pilipina pumunta doon para magtrabaho because sexual abuse in some tribes in the middle east have this notion that if you are a slave or you are a paid person working for them sexual abuse becomes part of the territory kaya diyan ako pumuputok at nakikita ko yung mga pamilya na sira and to think that they labored without sleep eating i said garbage and not being allowed to go to their own church to pray for that is prohibited by them and we have been just because of the money that they get we just look the other way around but still being — you know bothered every night and they what will happen to the next succeeding group of that is why i have in this speech a talk about slavery pero yan magprangka ako uli i would never deny and the icc can record it those who destroy my country i will kill you and those who destroy the young people of our country i will kill you talagang yayariin kita because i love my country you can do it the legal way but it would take you months and years and you know what the statistics i just learned the other night that plenty of those who are in the middle class have been released from prison despite the fact that they are charged with trafficking which is nonbailable and most of them are out babae pati lalaki ang kaso and that is why i said i toyed with the idea — i said if there is still a space — with due respect to the senate president he is a good man he can become a good vice president he is holy ngayon hindi na siya nahuhuli noon hulinghuli siya but with due respect to senator sotto who is also running for the vice presidency he is a capable man a good man and a filipino  sige ako tingin sa harap nandito pala sa likod ko  you know when you are old — i have been in politics mayor for  years five years as a congressman dito i worked here and four years of working as vice mayor for my daughter sara and the presidency i have been in politics almost —  plus four plus four — almost  kaya kung — hindi ko na malaman ang seat arrangement dito hindi ko alam nandoon pa ang mga senate president pati butit na lang hindi ko sinali si velasco baka hindi na ako makabalik doon maya di bale diretso na ako uwi i have said many times before the bloodshed caused by the separatist movement in mindanao is all about correcting the historical injustices suffered by the moro people since the period of colonization with the help of congress we were able to pass the organic law for the bangsamoro autonomous region in muslim mindanao  finally fulfilling a promise that was decades in the making our victory in marawi is also a testament to how the filipinos patriotism is far stronger than any extremist group as i have said before many times there is no room for lawlessness in this country  rebuilding a better marawi remains today still not completed to task force bangon marawi we need to race against time and you have to finish the necessary work to rehabilitate the wartorn city and bring back its  families back home now let me talk again about the drugs i was just ahead because i was talking something else nagsegue ako while we have made great strides in ending rebellion and insurgency in various parts of the country we still have a long way in our fight against the proliferation of drugs this problem has hounded our country for several decades — destroying families and degrading the moral fiber of our society when i assumed office i committed to end this problem at the soonest possible time we launched an unprecedented war against the illegal drugs and to destroy their apparatus that permeated every level and sector of society we waged war on the manufacturers the financiers the suppliers the peddlers and the entire syndicates and more importantly their protectors in government we have rescued and reformed drug dependents because of their idiotic sense of decency by  interventions and building facilities not only for their rehabilitation but also to prepare them to reintegrate into society our unyielding campaign led to the surrender of millions of drug dependents and neutralization capture and prosecution of thousands of drug personalities the dismantling of illegal drugs and syndicates and the drug laboratories the extensive drug of communities down to the barangaylevel and the cutting of narco politics you know just allow me a little bit of your time wala naman siguro kayong lakad ngayon unless na you want to — unless you have this appointment with im sure hindi babae yan that would be a sexist statement but kung nagmamadali talaga halos tumatakbo babae yan kung naglalakad lang nang natural medyo less important yan ganoon yan pero dito wala i am not making any sexist — im just saying — im just saying the truth what is the truth its there for all to see let me talk about our quest for infrastructure development five years ago the first thing i made sure was to increase our infrastructure spending to an average of five percent of the countrys gdp this is significantly higher than the infrastructure spending of each and  past four administrations thanks to the comprehensive tax reform program that enabled us to fund critical infrastructure projects today we can see the tangible results all around  with its frequent breakdowns and unloading of passengers midrail was a horror that was for the daily commuters to endure in the past now  no longer unloads passengers but to their destinations the waiting time between trains has been significantly reduced   trains running at only  kilometers per hour before now  runs  trains at  kilometers per hour  we have taken away the misery of public commuting we also pursued the completion of the  east extension project  by extending line  and adding two more stations we have reduced travel time between manila and antipolo from the usual two or three hours to only just  minutes  thanks to our partnership with the private sector we were able to open stage  of the metro manila skyway in january this year  this decongested edsa and other major roads in metro manila  on independence day last month we also inaugurated the kalayaan bridge part of the bgcortigas center link project  which will reduce the usual one hour travel time between the two business districts to just  minutes beyond metro manila we are pursuing several highimpact projects that will be completed within my term and perhaps in the following years its a question of money just this july we inspected the newlybuilt passenger terminal building of the clark international airport  the new and modern passenger terminal is equipped with the latest stateoftheart technology this can accommodate  million passengers alleviate air traffic congestion at the naia airport as well as serve as a major growth driver and gateway for northern and central luzon  madali man ang magpakpak ang basa ang mahirap  to help promote equitable development we also completed several roads leading to important trade corridors last year we completed the construction of the poro point freeport zone road in la union which improved —',\n",
       "  '  nakita na ninyo yan wala sige lang pakpak  you do not even have a picture of what i am talking about im sure — to improve access to prime spots for investments and tourism in the poro point area we also completed the junction lanaopagadianzamboanga city road which will provide easier access to farms and easily transport their agricultural products at low cost and in great quantities to industries and economic zones located in diplahan zamboanga sibugay  the sorsogon city in bicol inuna namin yan kasi mahal ko ang mga bicolano  pangatawanan ninyo yang pakpak ninyo ha baka the sorsogon city coastal bypass road is targeted for completion by the end of  while the davao city coastal road will be completed by  bakit why why is davao last kasi sinabi ko sa kanila unahin ninyo yung buong pilipinas during the initial years of my presidency i told the economic managers and the dpwh pati si art tugade sa transportation unahin ninyo ang luzon at ibang areas sa mindanao do not look into the political entrails of the city and the other provinces sinadya ko talaga na ipanghuli ang davao kaya ang — for the davaoeños you must understand that we cannot really unahin natin iyong — kasi taga diyan ako eh kung hindi ako sigurado tagadavao tapos na yan pareho ng iba kaya lang sinabi ko make davao the last priority  totoo yan sorsogon is a — a little politics but thats the territory of our vice president leni robredo are you here maam ah zoom mayroon ho kayong  sorsogon at iba pa we have inaugurated new highways roads and skyways we have bought new trains these are all testament that we have greatly eased the grueling experience of traveling and commuting and to sustain our momentum in infrastructure development i have directed the dpwh dotr neda department of finance and dbm to be on full speed to ensure that our flagship projects will be completed within my term  especially those that would help disperse economic activity outside the densely populated metro manila i thus earnestly call upon our lgu and private sector partners to help us  full speed towards the realization of our flagship  and others let me talk about — let me dwell about governance as we improved connectivity we worked towards greater convenience for our travelers we have extended the validity of philippine passports to  years to lessen the burden of our  travelers and ofws  we have also gone beyond merely addressing the three million backlog of drivers licenses in   we also extended for the new cards the validity of the drivers license to five years and addedly we shall begin the issuance of these drivers licenses within  years — which would be good for  years if there is no traffic violation  so punta ka doon sa lto maybe you have a good sight mayroong ano yan eh i think theres an examination there somewhere to test your ability to drive safely and you go back  years after and you think that you good — you still have a good sight and your reflexes are still good ten years maraming banggaan yan sigurado ako you know after  years no after five there should be a stricter measure to issue the  years validity of a drivers license by imposing stringent requirements to test the essential functions of eyesight then the hearing iyong iba hindi na nakakarinig ng silbato eh and so i have to you know  years is too long i like it its good but we should have as i said in five years we should go there for a medical makeover tingnan lang kung kaya pa mag not only did we extend the validity of licenses and passports we also sought to make long lines a thing of the past by streamlining government processes these efforts are embodied in the ease of doing business act which congress passed   thank you congress  sa inyo yun ako ang nagpirma pala ako nagexecute pakpak rin kayo  dapat ganoon ang sona sabihin mo lahat at sabihin mo na your — not really your qualms but your misgivings somewhere there  transactions will be further streamlined with the rollout of the philippine identification system or the philsys through the philippine identification system act with this we hope to facilitate better access  for all filipinos even in the farflung areas i want to say something about this but im taking too long you know we also ensured the modification of the salary schedule for civilian government personnel through the salary standardization law   — a necessary measure for our civil servants to recognize their work and accomplishments as well as a gesture of gratitude and good will we have this legacy and we hope to pass on the establishment of the central business portal a single site for all businessrelated transactions such as securing business permits licenses and clearances launched earlier this year it shall elevate our global standing in the doing business arena and improve our countrys competitiveness alam mo ito yung queuing when i was a mayor — i dont know but maybe a legislator or a senator or a congressman well not really he is higher than the others but kung dumaan ka as a local government employee worker just like me for  years itong queuing matagal ko na ito in davao ang passport issuances nandoon sa likod ng sm isang gabi nagmotor ako nakita ko yung mga paa sa semento so i was thinking anong nangyari dito so nagbaba ako sabi ko bakit dito kayo natutulog sabi nila you know mayor ang pagbukas niyan kailangan nakapila na kami pag hindi sunod — ibang araw na naman kami so i called for the chief of office and i said look i may not be the person above you supervising but make sure that this thing will not happen tomorrow as in tomorrow tapos tinawagan ko ang — itong ano sabi ko why dont you give cards kung marami sila paglinya may maglakad na marshal o ito ikaw bukas at  pm so you have to study the time and motion of people doing work sabi ko ayaw ko dito sa davao because in davao — in mindanao nasa davao ang ano eh ang issuances ng passport so ngayon pagkapresidente ko sabi ko ayaw ko nang makita yan not during my time not during my time maghanap ka ng ibang panahon ayusin ninyo yan i do not want people queuing under the heat of the sun and rain kaya sabi ko di magbigay kayo ng card they should go to one window magkuha kayo kung kailan sila makabalik so divide — i said study your time and the motion of you know the process of and dito nangyari na because i insisted today there is no more queuing especially in the national office — statistics office nakita ko talagang sabi ko na either you fix that thing or i will resign tomorrow because i could not bear to see those people hindi sa panahon ko kung hindi ko madala hindi ko man kayo mapatay hindi ko kayo mabugbog ako ang aalis sa gobyerno sabi ko ayusin ninyo yan hindi ko gustong makita yan since  the office of the president has issued  executive orders  administrative orders  memorandum circulars  memorandum orders and  proclamations these issuances have  integral guideposts in government administration and development agenda the office of the president has demonstrated careful stewardship of the powers by initiating reforms we upgraded and improved the systems and processes to ensure that it can provide the best service to the institution of the presidency and the offices under it and ultimately the filipino people to further promote transparency and accountability in government we also issued the order on freedom of information  opens up the records  transactions decisions and issuances of all government agencies in relation to this we also have the presidential anticorruption commission that is tasked to run after corrupt and erring government officials and bring them to justice  alam mo i dont know if you perhaps have come to know about this i have yung pastillas sa ano sa airport there were  personnel involved i fired them all talagang pinaalis ko sa gobyerno nagbalot pa nga ako ng pera sa pastillas sabi ko kay — magbalot ka lagyan mo ng pera kay ito ang ipakain ko sa kanila tinawag ko  of them from the immigration mabutit na lang nandiyan si justice secretary g',\n",
       "  'uevarra so that prevented me from doing it because kung hindi siya dumating — and i never expected him to be there — bigyan ko isat isa yung papel at ipakain ko talaga yung pera sa kanila gusto mo ng pera hala kainin mo that is the best way of then you fire them customs  plus  and everyday you have about — we have dismissed about  government personnel but some i did not allow the publication because ayaw — may mga pamilya eh so of late yung sabi nila na huwag na lang ano kasi nasasaktan yung mga pamilya so ngayon wala na i have stopped it but there is no — there is no saying that we cannot reimpose it again for all of these idiots i still have about a year to go i will — i will reach you somehow but corruption its endemic in government you cannot stop corruption nobody can stop corruption unless you overturn the government completely if i were the next president if you think theres really a need for you to change everybody in the system then you declare martial law and fire everybody and allow the new generation to come in to work for the government eh kung hindi mo ganunin walang mangyari nandiyan — its in the system eh kagaya ng drugs sino ba namang maniwala na nine — nine generals sa pulis were into trafficking of drugs and because they are — they are policemen the charges simply just you know disappear there because the prosecution the investigation which form part of the vital documents in court wala eh nobody was investigating because they are also policemen kaya yan kahirap ang ano kaya kung gusto mo itong mga to talagang the only way to do it just call them and say look for another job dont — dont ganoon kahirap now let me pursue my talk with the foreign policy of the country in the international arena we have vigorously pursued an independent foreign policy centered on the promotion and protection of our core national interests yet  sigurado kayo sa pinakpakan ninyo i was just laying the predicate of what i am going to say yet we conti — i will just give the cue then you clap your hands  if i yet we biro lang yan ha yet we continue to work with all nations and seek partnerships that work because despite differences it still is an interdependent world where interests and objectives intersect now partners – heretofore silent or equivocal – have expressed  principled positions that echo our own that  disputes and contested areas the majesty of the law must prevail and this is most welcome  to our friends in asean and around the world thank you for supporting my government my country and people when it truly mattered i assure you that the philippines will remain a responsible member of the international community  and we will work with you to achieve our shared objectives but no mistake — but no mistake but make no mistake rather gone are the days when the philippines decides and acts in the shadows of great powers we will assert what is rightfully ours and fight for what is rightfully due to the filipino people  we do not have any sona everyday now is as good as any other time to just let it out from sa puso mo this is why we sent back container vans of garbage because our country is not a dumpsite  and the first country to do that hindi ko alam kung bakit ang canada and the container was there for three years because hindi alam ng port authorities kung anong gawain nila sa garbage and i said isauli mo i want it done tomorrow those containers must be out of our country pag hindi kayong lahat all of you in customs ill fire you that is a good ground for dismissing people for accepting the garbage kaya may isa pa pero let me — let me end the story the balangiga we welcomed back the bells of balangiga after many decades because a historic wrong needed to be corrected  the deal was i would say i am in bad faith sigurado yan i will admit it but this is the real story the americans — former soldiers war veterans went to see me — i think that was in aguinaldo — and some military men and in no uncertain terms they said that you have been invited by trump to go to america have you decided to go there i said no why sabi ko i do not like the way that you are treating my country why i said for one and there was the clamor now of balangiga you return the bells of balangiga thats a war really sacred also to the soldiers then it is more sacred to us in addition to the religion — the roman catholic filipinos — the church ang sabi nila why dont we make a deal si hogan hes an ame — is he around hes a cia agent sabi niya isauli namin pupunta ka because i said earlier in my presidency there will never be a time that i will go to america eh itong mga media mahilig magudyok eh ah ganoon bakit ka hindi pupunta o arte mo lang yan eh sabi ko then you watch me di gusto ninyong malaman sabi ko sa america yes i might consider going to america so well then sabi ko work on it in just two months time they told me that the ship carrying the balangiga bells are on their way to deliver it to quezon  you removed it you put it back there kayo mismo so tulongtulong sila doon nabalik na and this hogan said na oh so when are you going to go to america sabi ko i do not have the time but i will go there noong malapit na hindi na talaga ako pumunta so well how about your promise sabi ko well i lost time to do it i cannot do it now pero talaga in my mind and the americans might know it i was — there was never in my mind a trip to america iyong balangiga sabi ko you massacred one barangay — barrio noon — women and children and all pinatay nila lahat because that bell balangiga was used to call the people for prayers ganoon sa simbahan yun eh so yung ginawa nila every time it is used the americans knew that it was — it has a great significance to the filipinos the balangiga after the massacre of one barangay how many at the time we would never know but it was i said isang barrio noon — barangay ngayon barrio noon yan eh barrio is an american word the barrio they also call the small places in mexico barrio the americans borrowed it from the spaniards barrio so sabi ko the blood — you really got it at the expense of the blood of filipinos i do not hurry me up if i go to america it will be in my own time pero actually wala ako i have not been to america for almost  years  —  years i have not visited america and i do not have any intention of visiting it anymore we called on the world to dismantle the heinous kafala system — ito ring isa — because the filipino is no slave and to anyone anywhere  and there is no room for modern day slavery we helped start a new global civil rights movement for the migrant worker and we asserted the arbitration ruling on the south china sea — clearly and in no uncertain terms — bilaterally  the asean and finally at the united nations general assembly  and let me talk about  i said in the september of last year the arbitral award is now part of the international law and beyond compromise and beyond the reach of the passing governments to dilute to diminish or abandon  that is the problem let me now — just to everybody — everybody in the middle east i would like to tell them that not only filipinos but all human beings the kafala has no place there because its a setup for slavery either you correct it or we will ask our workers filipino workers to go home sabi ko bahala na kung mahirap lang kami dito okay lang we will try our very best to make up for what they have lost what they will lose in the process but we will never allow them to be slaves but we need to do more with our partners we continue scaling  our maritime domain awareness  defense capabilities yet we will not close our doors on diplomacy and détente because that is how disputes are settled and never by force let me alam mo i respect the opinion you should be aware by now of how i talk especially on matters of — crucial matters that involved the country ito bang arbitral ruling ive said it in — i think in the latter part of the speech — i said that whats your problem in the arbitral ruling america an',\n",
       "  'd some filipinos — brilliant filipinos i would say — keep on pushing for something which i really do not know i have made a speech before the un nakazoom lang rin nandito lang ako hindi ako pumunta doon but in that speech i laid down the bare sabi ko — ng ating administrasyon ano pa ang gusto ninyo what will i do with a document that  not bind china because they were never a part of that arbitration there was really no arbitration at all because it was only the philippine side was heard well and good but ito ngayon that there is the arbitral ruling you know i do not want to insult these people pushing me for something more than what i can handle at ano ang gusto nila makipaggiyera do something what do something do you want war against china well ill tell you even on the coast beach of palawan before you can take off the missile of china would be there in about five or  minutes it would be a massacre if i go and fight a war now we are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side so what i did i was just being nice to them but for some people to say that i was helped by china in being president these idiots really i will never never do that hindi na bale ako hindi mapresidente hindi ko talaga gagawain yan to be what receiving money from china to buy votes they say that they helped maybe in some chinese communities the gossip going around was that support duterte but the whole of the chinese community in the philippines went for me why kasi sa davao noong mayor ako ni minsan hindi ako tumatanggap maski christmas gift dito marami sa dito sa maynila presidente ako ngayon maraming nagpapadala ng baril kung anong ano diyan sabi ko isauli mo yan iyong mga relo eh itong aking relo its iwc this is only  but the patek that has come  way isinauli ko talaga return it o pag hindi itapon mo sa pasig sa harapan nila hindi — hindi ako tinulungan ng china nagusap kami ng china civilly but after election and after election i was a good friend of president xi until now when the pandemic struck the first country i called for help was china president xi sabi ko mr president we have no vaccination program here because we do not have the vaccines we have not been able to invent one we might have a hard time he said no its okay well send you and he send us — donated about  of vaccines ganoon kaya nga sabi ko ako lalo na kaming mga bisaya mabigat sa amin yan for us visayans iyong utang na loob mabigat talaga yan hindi mo mabayaran ng ano pero pag may utang na loob ako sa iyo you can be sure that i will be your friend a true friend and die for you pero itong china magdayo bakit ako magpakamatay diyan iyang sundalo ko ubusin ko how can we fight china do we have the weapons do we have the — everything now comes america they say that if the attack is against the philippines they will defend but they issued a statement that america does not meddle in conflicts involving the boundaries of other nations and if america has to go to war you would have to go to congress to get — american congress to get the authority to go to war that is why many presidents hindi na lang — it was a — just a mere — an error a mistake — a malicious mistake no president has ever been punished for attacking nations getting into a fight with nothing and if they come here well ang problema kasi nandito na yung balangiga isauli na lang natin uli maybe ill just return it pag itoy its no big deal to us iyan ang bells ring it until you die fulfilling my promise to our coconut farmers and the filipino people my administration has worked with congress to pass the coconut farmers and industry trust fund act  we have returned also the coco levy funds to its true and rightful owners — our coconut farmers  the fund is now worth an estimated to be  billion  which will be utilized according to the plans and programs in the coconut farmers and industry development plan for the direct benefit of the coconut farmers and the development of the coconut industry in our effort to ensure that food is within reach of every filipino family we worked for the passage of the rice tariffication law in  despite pushbacks this resulted in the stabilization of rice supply and food prices the proceeds from the tariffs enabled us to provide our farmers with modern machineries that increased their yield and sustaining the growth in agricultural production we also fulfilled our promise to  free irrigation that was the first promise i made some — in san miguel bulacan when i was campaigning the farmers invited me to go into the farms inside san miguel bulacan and we had a sort of a — well a meeting and the first thing that they were complaining about was the severity of the irrigation that they have to pay  every month — ah every year si sabi ko i will work on it free irrigation service act of  is a product that now lowers the cost of agricultural production especially for poor farmers we also worked to ensure that households have adequate supply of clean water potable and affordable water is more than a commodity it is a vital public good this is why i used my political capital to fight vested interests behind disadvantageous water service contracts  that burdened consumers with unjustified water price increases with the signing of  with water concessionaires consumers will be protected at least until  ganito yan eh there is this concessionaire dalawa ayaw ko na lang magano — i will not mention names pero this is really what happened ang dalawang concessionaires one in the south and the one is north as the rich cartel dito sa southeast asia ang kinacapture nila ang electricity pati tubig dito sa tubig in this contract with the water concessionaires we made so many concessions that really sabi ko if you look at the contract and look at the antigraft law talagang its all antigraft all of the sentences even the period and the question marks there ah bakit sila walang problema sa tax because the people consumers will pay the taxes for them sila kung malugi sabi nila hindi nila kasalanan and we can — i can think of it through not of their own fault sabi doon bayaran natin sila malugi we pay for the tax corporation nila at sila ang magdecide kung iincrease nila o idecrease nila ang water prices the regulators itong mga regulators sa pilipinas walang magawa and they acceded to the contract it was really — i do not know how to put it kaya ako nagpardon di ba nagmura ako sabi ko biro mo kung malugi sila babayaran pa natin tayo ang — ang corporate tax nila tayo ang magbayad and its a cartel that service concessionaires are part of the cartel of malaysia and indonesia and they form part of that mother corporation itong mga sa pilipinas pati sa malaysia indonesia they are just — kumbaga sa istorya chapter lang yan sila its being controlled up by the kaya sabi ko wala ito i told them — i told dominguez tell them that i am no longer honoring the contract mayroon pa doon payment of itong tax — water treatment plant to be constructed in the harrison plaza site iyon ang pinirmahan natin so  up to the present or up to the month that i blew my top nagbabayad — ewan ko kung ngayon nagbabayad na theres a kuwan there sa water bills ninyo for enhancement of quality water ang ibig sabihin water treatment and they were collecting since  so until now how much of the filipinos money are with them for nothing not even for a song kaya ako if there is something — hindi naman proud — but if there is something someday that my children will say what have you done for my country sabihin ko sila talagang inupakan ko sila sabi ko  ayaw ninyo you do not want it well okay i will — i will just confiscate your system and call the military to operate it i will exercise the eminent domain and expropriate all of your assets here kasi gagawin ko iyon ang nangyari sa so sinabi ko sa military in one of our meetings immediately after that incident i said if i do not make it to the finish line kindly — look kindly at the filipino at tanungin ninyo kung ano na ang nangyari sa kan',\n",
       "  'ila iyang tubig na yan now there is a new contract i have not yet — i have to thoroughly digest it inside i have to absorb it every word of it that the filipino is protected pag nandiyan na yan then i will sign but i will not forget im telling them the crime is there already and any filipino who would want to go after you can sabi ko i will not free you i will not — theres no way were — in your i will never allow that just make a new contract just realize everyday that i can call you itong frequency frequency ng abscbn iyan ang pinakaideal kasi you know frequency is everywhere but there is a spot kung sa golf a soft spot na maganda yung wala akong problema sa abscbn they got my money im not they wanted to return it when the case blew up at they printed all the garbage including my daughter as a drug trafficker nilamon ko na lang lahat yun because i never wanted to be — to appear vindictive but itong ano they are cheating government by the billions in taxes and they still want that frequency because yan ang pinapagawayan no i will give it to a filipino na gustong maggawa nang tamang ano and pay because sa abscbn yung even their equipment were imported taxfree kaya talaga ako hindi magpapayag they still owe government billions in the contract diyan sa nakalagay doon four hectares so ang binabayaran nila four hectares sa property taxes supposed they are occupying  hectares that complex there pero ginamit nila na papel yung four hectares iyon lang ang binabayaran nila kung hindi ba naman kaya ko sila inaway and well our micro small and medium enterprises or msmes constitute  percent of our countrys businesses and are vital to economic activity job creation and poverty reduction ipinaramdam natin ang ating malasakit sa maliliit na negosyante sa pamamagitan ng pondo sa pagbabago at pagasenso program since  mayroon na tayo niyan we have the program the program has provided over  underprivileged microentrepreneurs with an alternative to the exploitative lending  iyan ang naka ano sa you know what maybe i have to go to — if need be i have to go to india iyong  nila ng turko tinatawag nilang turko kung maghiram ka sa kanila ng  pahiramin ka niyang hindi pera  six seven thousand lang and the others mga refrigerator or the things that you do not even need in the house bilhin mo sa kanila sala set lahat na that is part of you do not want the furniture the refrigerators they wont give you the kaya ang pilipino nabuktot alam mo ang buktot naging hunchback na lang sa trabaho ganoon pa man kaya ako sasabihin ko itong mga turko you better come up with a fair scheme if you want to go into business sa money lending but not at that usu — usury a thousand times likewise to further support development of our micro and small businesses we  radical reforms in the tax system to ease the taxation burden and increase the net income of lower wage earners and small businesses thanks to congress  iyan hindi pa ninyo alam ha sabi ko lang thanks to congress and our revenue generating agencies our tax reforms sustained our economic growth from the third quarter of  to the fourth quarter of  which made the philippines one of the fastest growing economies in asia until the  pandemic scourge iyon talaga ang well i dont know whats the plan of god he sent us something which hit us right in the heart we see so many — theres no way of telling when this virus would disappear from the planet of the earth we can only pray to god to look into our direction and decide on what will happen to this planet he created however tax laws are not always perfect and that is why every now and then they have to be revisited to see if they are at pace with the changing times let us therefore continue to monitor the relevance and impact of our tax laws on individuals and private institutions to prevent serious damage on their financial health going now to the social and health issues to unburden our people of the hefty costs of tertiary education my administration worked with congress to pass a landmark legislation that had remained unpassed for so many years the universal access to quality tertiary education act in  which provides free education to college students in state universities  thank you congress we also passed the universal health care act in  and to supplement this i also signed into law the malasakit centers act in   kasi ganito yan eh pag ang pobreng pilipino nasa ospital magpunta pa siya doon sa kung saan makahingi ng tulong so ang ginawa just like in davao ginawa namin yung lahat na kailangan yung internal revenue kung nandiyan business permit diyan na lang sa isang lugar medisina kunin nila diyan mismo sa ospital hindi na sila maglakadlakad and to me that is one of the most — let me find the word — a poignant act of congress and of the executive department   legislation which was sponsored by senator bong go  — if you feel like standing up you can senator  mas sikat ka pa sa guest speaker —  unburdened our people of the tedious process of going to various agencies and offices in order to avail of assistance from government i am pleased to report that we have already established  malasakit centers across the country  that has already helped millions of filipinos in their hospitalization needs by establishing malasakit centers all over the country we have actually levelled the playing field and provided our less fortunate countrymen the medical care they deserve we will be establishing more god willing if we are still around sa pagtatag ng malasakit center hindi na po kailangan lumapit at humingi ng tulong sa ibat ibang ahensya ng gobyerno ang gobyerno na ang lumalapit sa tao  so let us talk about covid its mentioned everywhere in the speech but what — whats this gd virus is i have to admit back when i decided to answer your call and run for higher office never never did i imagine that my presidency would not only be judged by how i made good on my campaign promises in fighting illegal drugs criminality and corruption but by how well i led our nation dumake — during rather the global pandemic hindi na ako makapronounce mabuti baka mayroon na ako  may ambulansya ba diyan mukhang iba na ang you know i cannot pronounce the words i hope this is not asymptomatic  prior to the pandemic we recorded our lowest debttogdp ratio since  the highest revenue effort since  the highest credit rating in the countrys history — yung sa bangko — because if your rating is high its easy to borrow at maliit lang ang interest that is the dynamics of a rating by fitch — fitch and   poors mga ganoon — and the lowest rates of unemployment underemployment and poverty well its still there it is beyond dispute that our economic and governance fundamentals were robust when  hit us i am sure that much can be said about the way we took on the daunting challenge of preserving lives while sustaining our momentum towards  developmental — dito na lang ako — goals naturally we prioritized saving lives buhay muna bago ang lahat ibig sabihin inuna natin yung gastos — yung pera natin sa pandemic kinuha ng — lahat ng anong mga budget si dominguez yan iyon ang ginamit ninyo sa bayanihan  and  doon natin kinuha yung pera we moved quickly to safeguard the wellbeing of every filipino through preventive and responsive health and safety measures and broad and inclusive social amelioration programs or sap thanks to the support of congress we launched the most extensive social protection program in our countrys history with the passage of bayanihan  and bayanihan   indeed our national health system and resilience were tested to the hilt countless lessons were learned and continuous improvements put in place kahit anong krisis ay kayang malampasan kung tunay na may malasakit at bayanihan i agree at the early stages of the pandemic our testing capacity was very limited recognizing the importance of conducting more tests to ensure early detection and timely isolation of confirmed  cases we ramped up our testing capacity we now have more than  a',\n",
       "  'ccredited laboratories nationwide which is capable of conducting at least  tests daily all regions now can conduct their own  tests to take care of mild and asymptomatic cases we established over  temporary treatment and monitoring facilities across the country with a total bed capacity of more than  together with local governments and the private sector we quickly established mega quarantine facilities that could accommodate more cases modular hospitals and quarantine facilities have also been established nationwide especially in metro manila for our severe covid cases our tireless healthcare workers ensure that you are provided with the best care round the clock based on latest developments and global best practices our health experts continue to actively participate in the search for safe and effective  medicines with the help of congress kita mo sa lahat i never said wala kang makikita that i  the key construction of a bridge that is nowhere to be found today iyong mga ganoon ako sa inyo talaga with the help of congress we passed  measures that established new and improved the capacity of existing hospitals around the country to provide quality care and services to our people especially amid the ongoing   these include establishing new medical facilities in mandaluyong city bacolod and davao occidental increasing bed capacities of existing health facilities in quezon city ilocos sur la union and palawan  upgrading health facilities in that area to include leyte currently we have received over  million doses of  vaccines we expect   million vaccines this month and in august we have inoculated more than  million filipinos  —  of which have received their first dose at least  million well i think the landscape — the health landscape of the country continues to improve as we you know with the continuous  of  vaccines we are ready to boost further our daily vaccination rate i am also encouraging our local government units to hasten their roll out and strengthen their inoculation program san juan city for one  have vaccinated  percent of their population in a months time saludo ako sa inyo  at kay mayor zamora we cannot continue living in the shadow of this potent enemy especially now that science and medicine has proven that it is possible to live with — if not entirely defeat — this virus the health and safety protocols we put in place have proven effective in slowing the spread of the virus but the best solution is still vaccination am i too mataas na ba kasi kung mataas na putulin na lang ninyo itong gumagalaw dito para sabihin ko eh wala na man akong mabasa pag matagal na those who want to go home you raise your right hands  pati si monsignor baka itaas niya ang kamay niya eh  that is why i implore our countrymen who are now in the list of sectors to be inoculated to get vaccinated now to those who received their first doses please return for your second shot i also ask for patience to those who are next in line to receive their vaccine more and more  vaccines are arriving each week and you will soon have your turn corollary to this it is high time that clear precise and uniform protocols and guidelines are issued in anticipation of the vaccination of more filipinos and the steady reopening of our society you know pagpasensyahan ninyo ako i i ask i beg your kind indulgence but i have to say this — to talk about something which would affect us all iyang it seems that this government is too far away from the people iyong serbisyo talaga na totoo noong isang araw nakita ko i dont know what place was that ang mga tao nakapila and they say that they were there at  oclock lumalakas yung ulan sa payong lang sila so nanonood ako sa report because i listen to the report every morning makukuha mo sa mga radio station yan eh so i was having breakfast i was listening to the tv at nakita ko yung mga tao nakapila lumalakas ang ulan sabi ko p eh doon sa breakfast table nagmura ako pero dito good boy man ako kay may mga religious diyan baka i thus call on the national task force against  to see to it that this happens — i mean the protection we have spent enormous amounts of resources to build our capacities to overcome this pandemic we cannot afford more lockdowns lest our economy bleeds to the point of irreversible damage balikan ko yung ano bakit mo papilahin at sabi kasi doon libre lahat na wala ng ano so nagpuntahan yung mga tao na nagpila kasi wala nang listalista pero sabi ng mga ito alas kwatro pa sila t i hindi lang ako puwedeng mag alam mo sa totoo lang hindi naman ako nagyayabang i am just an ordinary filipino citizen just like you i get hurt when people are nearly almost brutalized bakit hindi ka magkuha its rain time malakas ang monsoon — southwest monsoon dumadaan talaga sa pilipinas gamitin mo ang utak mo you should look for a gym at bigyan mo lahat ng tao ng number hanggang dito lang for this hanggang dito lang tayo balik kayo itong bukas from  to  kayo na naman bukas bigyan mo ng card prepare a card where you can — the marshal will go around the queuing na bakit mo hindi ko maintindihan — theres media — hindi ko maintindihan bakit gawain mo yan sa pilipino iyan ang tinatanong ko why do you have to do it to the filipino you can always — you know maghanap ka ng tsk there is always a gymnasium mga eskwelahan walang klase ngayon bakit hindi mo gamitin doon bakit ka maghanap ng isang room t na kaya lang ako well it is my — to my chagrin because im gusto kong lumabas itong psg lang na ito ang you know sabihin ko sa inyo huwag kayong magpresidente kay wala talagang sabihin ko maliit ang suweldo wala ka if you are not there really for the — magcorrupt ka diyan well it would make you a billionaire overnight but kung magtrabaho ka lang ng ganito ako presidente gusto kong lumabas doon sabihin ko hoy mga p i ninyo bakit ganito to bakit ganoon kayo kaestupido i mean the filipino does not deserve it even if they are not paying taxes because the theory of government is that all money belongs to the people and the money is there it belongs to all of us and it should be used for public good but what — what is the use of public good if you are not good and stupid so ganoon ang mangyayari sa pilipino im just letting off my kasi kung hindi lang talaga bawal eh itong psg hindi ako pinapalabas magsabi ako magpunta ako doon sir hindi puwede yan hindi puwede kulong talaga ako magpresidente ka sa totoo lang you are a prisoner you are brought here kunwari ka pa dechopper ka deguwardiya tapos uwi ka doon sa bahay mo tapos hindi ka na makalabas preso ka talaga tawagin mo yung security yung gusto kong pumunta sir hindi pasensya na tapos pagalitan mo sabihin sir eh ang authority namin does not come from you it comes from a law so kami ang masunod talagang sige ka pirma a bunch of papers if you read it hanggang umaga trabaho ka suweldo mo ganoon lang just give me  tapos ganoon ang trabaho magisa ka butit ngayon kay nandito yung asawa ko nandito yung anak ko nabubuhay yung loob ko maguwi ako sa bahay ngayon tsk looking forward today is my last  but this is by no means my swan song i shall never cease to implore congress to pass vital and critical legislation as well as push the entire government to ensure nothing less than the full recovery and revitalization of our country but to do this it is necessary for us to first overcome the crippling fear anxiety and uncertainty that caused — that was caused by the threat of the  virus well i really do not know what to do i have to listen to the task force this is a group of people volunteering to be a collective advisor that would give you the advice collectively we put it that way na sila ang magano magsabi and were just waiting for the word i am referring to covid d delta it is rampaging now in indonesia thailand india and many parts of asia and ang sabi doon sa — the western medicine says that it is far more aggressive and far more dangerous and it can cause death easily than the  original so this is as good as any other time to s',\n",
       "  'ay it if sees that it is really dangerous you have to go back to lockdown if there are many people in other parts of the world killing as many then delta if ever it will spread — we have it here now — i hope it will not go any further but if something wrong happens ill have to be strict and i have now my word that there will be a just like what happened in the early days eh kung ganoon ang covid d saan tayo pupunta and if there is — it requires a new vaccine we do not have it yet i do not know what maybe we will just have to pray for salvation sabihin natin diyos we have done everything but you know this time we are really put hard on these things that happened rest assured that we will exert every effort to restore the lost livelihood of our affected countrymen i have recently signed an executive order creating the task force that will shepherd the countrys national employment recovery strategy the task force recently partnered with the employers confederation of the philippines to implement the reform rebound and recover program that aims to vaccinate qualified workers to fill in more than one million jobs these jobs will be created by different business associations in the fields of construction information technology bpo and electronics to our business associations thank you for joining in our effort to bring back lost income opportunities for our workforce another important component of our employment recovery strategy is the retooling of our workers to prepare them for better job opportunities since the start of community quarantines over  million  availed of the tesdas free online training programs i am directing the national employment recovery strategy task force particularly tesda to ensure the upskilling of our workers and increase their employability i expect the task force to work double time not only to recoup job losses but more importantly to rehabilitate the economy and help our hardest hit sectors  through the  assistance to restart enterprises or cares program we released  million pesos worth of loans to over  enterprises  bayanihan   bayanihan  we released  billion pesos worth of loans to over  enterprises including our displaced ofws and enterprises in the tourism sector to help them start or sustain their businesses amid the pandemic along this line i would like to renew my call to congress to immediately pass the amendments of priority legislative measures such as the foreign investments act the public service act and the retail trade liberalization act  your applause went well ahead of its realization you have to work on this guys and well i am sure that we can have a respite of this contagion in a — in your own little way finally i would like to reiterate my call for congress again to pass legislation to establish a single agency that shall focus on and respond quickly to the needs and concerns of our ofws i pray that our next leaders and our future generations will not squander our natural resources and fight for the integrity of our environment in a manner fiercer and more effective than my administration had ever done the pandemic has taken so much from us as a nation but like  other adversities that tested us time and again it can never take  our courage and resilience and the spirit of bayanihan  — rather bayanihan and the value of malasakit are now indelible in us filipinos we shall use these gifts to forge ahead towards a better normal as we come to a point where the risk of  transmission can to a certain extent be managed i am hopeful that we shall be united in forging ahead towards bringing the country back to its robust growth path let me end by adding these particular statements well on learning — education and learning despite our inability to conduct facetoface classes during this pandemic we remain determined to deliver quality and accessible education to all the creation of the basic education learning continuity plan enabled the uninterrupted learning of students in the basic education sector while ensuring their and teachers health safety and wellbeing while the pandemic has demonstrated the readiness resourcefulness and capability of government to serve the filipino people through the use of ict and digital services it has also shown its inherent deficiencies and weaknesses as such i ask congress to pass an egovernance act that will set up the transition of government processes to the digital age i would like to add something on the protection of our overseas filipinos i also ask congress to pass a law creating the department of migrant workers and overseas filipinos  — kailangan po ito because they are suffering not on — they suffered not only yesterday but they are still suffering now with so many inadequacies in both our government response including the monetary assistance — to ensure that there is a department that is solely focused on addressing the needs and taking care of the welfare of our countrymen abroad before i end let me also touch on the environmental protection it has also been  years since the supreme court through a mandamus ordered the rehabilitation of manila bay unfortunately no immediate substantial action to comply with the supreme courts order was undertaken until  when this administration started its long overdue rehabilitation as of may  all illegally operating open dumpsites surrounding manila bay have been shut down while  out of  lgus surrounding the bay now have access to sanitary landfills establishments have been forced to comply with environmental laws and ordinances while those who did not have been closed down as a result pollutants have been largely reduced and coliform levels — also reduced to its barest maximum — are now on its lowest levels in years if not decades i urge the denr to sustain its efforts and continue working with our lgus to restore manila bay to its former glory  you know just one little thing before we end iyong pagano sa manila bay well there is a corner where all the garbage con — by current — by action of the current nandito marami sa likod ng luneta ginawa natin yan at nilagay natin itong yung puting bato na which is well scattered into small pieces eh nawawala minsan yan because of the waves so every now and then we still have to replenish because we cannot change the nature of our shores that is how it is it is not a permanent fixture there  it is there from the mountains and we break it down and bring it to the sea but that would occupy that place irrespective of there is a high tide or low tide nakakatulong yan at nawawala yan and the only way to do it is to replenish it until we can think of a good alternative of how we can process the whole thing back to its normalcy if there was really normalcy at the time or at any other time in the past on the resilience again dinagdag ko na lang ito time is good and as any other time again to ask you in line with this we hope to pursue the creation of public entities dedicated to managing emerging and reemerging diseases i thus fervently ask congress to enact a law creating the center for disease prevention and control and the virology and vaccine institute of the philippines we must  maski gaano natin kahirap however poor we are i think that the filipinos given the proper support and the things there the equipment that they have to use we can — i am sure that the filipino brain can also process or make vaccines in the future  tapos na po yan maam i ask congress to pass the — yan — disaster resilience act that will create the department of disaster resilience let us also — pagkatapos nito maam ikaw yung unang tao na magcongratulate sa akin ha kaya ako nagkautalutal dito eh dahil sa iyo let us also pass the law implementing the fire protection modernization program to bolster the readiness of our firefighters and ensure their ability to respond to fires and disasters related to this  importante yang trabaho ng bumbero maniwala kayo they must also be there during any disaster happening let us also push for',\n",
       "  ' the mandatory establishment of evacuation centers in every city province and municipality throughout the country which shall provide the basic needs and assistance to all evacuees during times of emergency now there is now the conclusion sabi hay salamat  sabi  pg duterte to oh the lights go out for this administration eleven months from now the work that we started and expected to finish within the constitutional time frame of six years has been stalled much was hoped for but we need not despair desperation is a feeling alien to the resilient filipino a peaceful and prosperous philippines is no longer a distant dream but one that is within our grasp if our future filipinos would also do it — if would continue the — if they would continue and would seize the opportunity to work together malaki ang pasasalamat ng mga kababayan natin at lagi nilang sinasabi na mas panatag ang loob nila ngayon hindi na nababahala ang mga magulang na lumalabas ang mga anak nila at naglalakad sa gabi  i will not elaborate on anything you can draw your conclusion alam mo when the filipino a father a mother or a child naglalakad sa gabi at siya ay — kagaya ng iba even in america you go into the inner cities of la and new york you — sa washington dc theres a corner there theres a — do not go there because you will not come out alive ganoon kung hindi maglakad na sila puro takot na lang ang nasa loob nila maholdup sa jeep tapos pati yung taga ombudsman na buntis patay pa pati yung bata sa loob ng tiyan just to get the money to buy shabu because when the monkey is riding on your back iyong katawan mo hindi mo na maano that is why you need to higop — sip kailangan mo maghigop at kailangan mo pumatay pag wala kang pera hindi naman talagang papatay maybe not the mind is not ready for that but in the struggle you put up a struggle if you are the owner of the money eh talagang papatayin ka pag hindi mo ibigay iyan ang ayaw ko kaya noong namayor ako sa davao ganito mga p i — mga p i niyo umalis kayo sa daan yung daan yung public transportation is for public good huwag mo silang takutin na magkanto pag uwi nandiyan nagiinuman sa — iyan ang hilig ng pilipinong — maginuman hindi mo malaman ang mga naguwi na babae they have to take another route that would be longer because nandiyan mga istambay so the streets are unsafe hinoholdup pinapatay sabi ko doon sa davao — sa davao na lang huwag na lang ako dito sa maynila hindi naman talaga ako nakikialam dito pero alam nila alam ng pulis kung ano ang gusto ko magprangkahan tayo sabi ko sa pulis isauli mo yan the roads the highways are for lawabiding citizens of this country iyong mga kriminal yung mga — well the dregs of society huwag ninyong gamitin yang mga daan hindi para sa inyo yan and i will see to it that you are not there be sure that when i pass by i do not see you because if i see you i will dance with you isauli ko kaya ngayon medyo hindi naman talaga ano but yung mga sales girl ng mga — mga shopping center eh panatag na ang loob nila at least ang chances of being mugged murdered and raped iyan ang ayaw ko pag malayo nakahigop na kunin yung pera hilain doon sa medyo maliit na mga grassy portion and rape at papatayin iyan ang hindi ko matanggap just like yang pilipino sabi ko i may be — i may be just a little bit crazier than the others but that is what i am ayaw ko yung — lalo na mag — magshabu ka tapos magpasyal ka kung ano wala kang makuhang pera aakyat ka ng bahay just like that bank teller it was raining so hard just like the rains that we had experienced it was pouring almost cats and  ang lakas talaga nang bagsak ng ulan she went home to knock the door and pump the door loud but ang parents nilang matanda — matanda na yung parents hindi nakarinig so anong ginawa nitong ma — mga sa construction workers sabi ko diyan nga ako galit sa droga eh nabibili nila mura its   susuyupin nila at pag nakasuyop ng droga yan maghanap ng alcohol yan sigurado yan pag tama ng alcohol pati yung ano ng droga it shrinks the brain yon iyong babae dinampot — she was just picked up and brought to the construction site near the house tapos nirape doon pinatay sinunog pa iyan ang hindi ko talaga maintindihan i cannot reco iyong bata na  rapein mo ang problema nito ang nakikita nila ang patay na mga kriminal well how about the victims on the other side bakit hindi ninyo tingnan and see what these criminals have done to our children to our wives and daughters may listahan kayo p ang listahan ninyo doon sa namatay hindi ba kayo maligaya niyan wala ng kriminal pero pag tingin mo dito ilan ang patay na inosente pati pulis ko at sundalo namamatay diyan baka akala ninyo kriminal lang so that is my lamentations and i just want you to hear in my five years in office we made real change in governance through the reforms we pursued however for this governance — must be sustained and broadened we need to make im not — im just getting my air naghihingal ako baka — baka dito ako mamatay pagkapresidente iba na ang pitik ng ano ko ngayon ng kasingkasing ko kasingkasing is puso  to make every public servant responsive to the needs of the people and enjoin every filipino to assert their right to demand malasakit from their leaders until everyone lives with dignity — wellfed educated healthy secure disciplined and empowered — to contribute to national development i will not be forever be president but ang kulang sa pilipino is assertiveness pag may — mayroon kayong transaction at hingian kayo ang sabi ko sa inyo ito ang payo ko murahin mo sabihin mo p i ka nagtatrabaho kayo at kami dito we are following papers and you are sitting on your a on it kaya dito sabi ko makinig kayong lahat ng pilipino tutal last sona ko na ito pag may magfollow up kayo permit clearance at maghingi ng pera murahin ninyo sabihin ninyo yan sabi ni duterte sampalin ko kayo kasi ako nagbabayad ng buwis bakit ginaganito ninyo and to the mga pilipino hindi naman lahat tayong nagtatrabaho sa gobyerno i mean it takes you one month to process a paper it takes you — tapos pabalikbalik yung tao pag ang tao bumabalik dalawa isa tatlo then there is corruption there murahin mo at kung maaari pahiramin kita ng pangkulam para kulamin mo ganoon talaga im just warning everybody theres still one year to go in davao three days lagyan mo ng papel bumalik ka dito at this hour on thursday at pagka naipakita mo yung papel hanapin niyo yung ibibigay iyan ang gamitin ninyo for all the local governments also in my cabinet its  days walang extension all sabi ko you reduce the signing authority from six seven to only one or two hindi naman pala kailangan  hindi kailangan magpirma lahat ng empleyado diyan one or two iyong iba magprocess lang but if you cannot process it also in so many days in davao if you sub — if it is a clearance which is long overdue hindi mo na puwedeng ibigay doon sa tao ibigay mo sa akin at tanungin kita  mo bakit inabot ka ng ganito wala — there is no other conclusion corruption yan kagaya what is true in davao is true for the entire philippines mabutit na rin yan nakapagsalita ako ng freely with you tutal last ko naman na itong sona mabuti yang malaman ng tao na ganoon ang ginagawa nila its not there hindi man — hindi man nila lalagay yang mga ganoon na wala mang mura diyan be careful this is we need to fight to subdue narrow vested interests and ensure that our gains will  to the benefit of the greater number of filipinos especially those who have the least in life we have laid down the groundwork and are continuing to push for landmark reforms and key accomplishments up to the last days of my term i have full confidence that the filipino spirit pati ako nagmamadali na eh naiihi na kanina pa eh  its a natural human biology so whats the big deal bakit kayo magpakpak kung napaihi na ako  sabagay alam ko rin nahihiya kayong magtindig puno ang pila nito pagdating sa cr mamaya  i have full confidence that the filipino spirit will persevere and triumph together let us rise as a nation thank you  — end']]"
